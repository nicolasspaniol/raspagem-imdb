tt0048287,Spectacular and exciting adaptation about ¨ El Alamo¨ with epic finale battle,6.0,"In the habitual group of various characters we find the starring Jim Bowie of ¨Bowie knife¨ fame (Sterling Hayden) who held command until stricken with typhoid-pneumonia , Colonel William Barret Travis (Richard Carlson) , commander of the small garrison of some 180 men and Davy Crockett of Tenesse (Arthut Hunnicutt) who had arrived with a dozen volunteers . They're guarding El Alamo against a Mexican militia commanded by General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna , President of Mexico (J. Carroll Nash) . They're featured in more realistic roles than successive films , though here predominates the melodrama . It's a spectacular film hampered by a tiring screenplay and including Max Steiner's excellent score with a title song by Gordon McRae . The motion picture well produced by Republic's founder , Herbert J. Yates, was professionally directed by Frank Lloyd . Subsequently , five years later , John Wayne made his own retelling : ¨El Álamo¨ (1960) , utilizing a lot of the still-standing sets that were used in this movie . The film is rightly based on historic events , these are the followings : On 23 February 1836 a army of 5000 entered San Antonio. When Santa Anna demanded the surrender, William Travis answered with a cannon shot. So began thirteen day siege that ended with the Mexicans storming the fortress, the defenders, to a man , fought on until death .With bugles sounding the ¨deguello¨(signifying no quarter to the defenders) attacked the adobe walls from all four sides and broke through. Travis was shot dead over his cannon . Crockett using his rifle as a club, fell under a swarm of the enemy . Bowie fought to the last from his sickbead. The Mexicans had won a Pyrrhic victory suffering more than 1500 casualties. Forty six days after the fall ,less than 800 Texans and American volunteers led by General San Houston defeated Santa Anna and his army of 1300 at San Jacinto. Shouting ¨Remember the Alamo¨ Houston's men completely routed the Mexicans in a matter of minutes, killing 630 while losing only 8. Santa Anna was captured, and the Republic of Texas was born.",33,38,False
tt0048287,One of Republic's best,8.0,"Frank Lloyd's career stretched back to the silent era--he was a major director and made films for the top studios in Hollywood. Winding up at a B studio like Republic would seem to be a step down the career ladder, but this film is actually one of Lloyd's best and one of the best to ever come out of Republic.The studio didn't often get the services of directors of the calibre of Frank Lloyd--although John Ford and Fritz Lang had occasionally made films there--and it spared no expense on this one. The subject matter demanded a big budget, and Republic didn't stint. Thousands of extras, big sets, spectacular action scenes, robust performances--all combined to make a first-rate action picture. Sterling Hayden makes a good Jim Bowie, the always underrated Arthur Hunnicutt personifies Davy Crockett, and the cast is filled with familiar character actors--Roy Roberts, Slim Pickens, John Russell, Jim Davis--who contribute much to the overall atmosphere of the film. The setpiece of the movie, though, is the final siege of the Alamo itself, and it is spectacular. It compares well to the John Wayne version made five years later, and ranks right up there with the final battle scene in 1964's ""Zulu""--expertly edited with top-notch stunt-work and special effects. Very highly recommended.",30,37,False
tt0048287,First and Best,,"I always liked this Alamo epic better than Wayne's because it moved faster and Sterling Hayden and Arthur Hunnicutt looked like Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett might have been.  Hunnicutt's death scene  influenced Wayne's in his epic but I'll rate Hunnicutt's an A+ for less ""operatic"" posing and a more real ""I'll take you to hell with me realism.   The teeny bopper love angle could've of been dropped though.",21,29,False
tt0048287,Rated as the best of the Alamo films.,9.0,"Amoung alot of historians and reenactors, this is the best Alamo film ever made. It was very well done, acted, and directed. An all around great job by all! Alamo: Price of Freedom is the most accurate film ever made, but this film is considered the best by far!",16,26,False
tt0048287,Historic accuracy vs bravery,8.0,"While not totally historically accurate, this film is at least as accurate, if not more so, than most of the other Alamo epics. There are points in all the films that are arguable, if not totally wrong. However, I have researched most of the Alamo films and find this one more accurate from the viewpoint of the depiction of the Mexicans in the Alamo and some of the more personal facts about Bowie. For example, the death of his wife sometime before the start of the battle. No Alamo film is totally accurate, including the newly made Alamo with Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Quaid. The important thing is that this is the story of brave men fighting a battle they cannot win against a far larger army. The spirit of the story is the important thing in this case.",19,23,False
tt0048287,"Rousing, if Modestly Budgeted...",,"'The Last Command' is a film with a better backstory than the film itself! First batted around Republic Pictures as a potential vehicle for John Wayne, the production was put on the back burner when Wayne decided he wanted total creative control, and decided to produce and direct his own version, with a budget Republic couldn't match.Republic DID, however, have an arsenal of talent available, and a shooting script, and eventually brought in veteran director Frank Lloyd, who had just come off a ten-year hiatus with 'The Shanghai Story', in 1954. Sterling Hayden, fresh from the cult classic 'Johnny Guitar', and a featured role in Fox's lavish 'Prince Valiant', signed to play Jim Bowie (""I needed the money to refit my boat,"" he joked). Richard Carlson, whose 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' had just been released by Universal (becoming a big hit) was tapped to play Alamo commander William Barret Travis. Ernest Borgnine, whose 'Marty' was garnering rave reviews (and would earn him an Oscar) took on the showy supporting role of Bowie adversary/friend Mike Radin and starlet Anna Maria Alberghetti, in her first non-singing role, became the female lead. Two veteran character actors rounded out the major cast: J. Carrol Naish, as a sympathetic yet decisive Santa Anna, and, in an offbeat but inspired casting move, bearded Arthur Hunnicutt as a rustic Davy Crockett (who would very nearly steal the film!).The production was very modestly budgeted, so much so that the number of extras serving as the Mexican army was limited, but director Lloyd and cinematographer Jack Marta were old hands at making more out of less, and with some judicious editing by Tony Martinelli, the illusion of thousands of Mexican soldiers was achieved. Set design was minimal, as well, and the famous 'look' of the church/fortress was often achieved through mat paintings.Scored by the legendary Max Steiner, with a theme sung by Gordon MacRae, 'The Last Command' seemed to teeter at the edge between 'B' movie and 'A' status; ultimately, the pedestrian script, by Sy Bartlett and Warren Duff, did the movie in, as there was too much time spent on an unnecessary love triangle, which slowed much of the film to a crawl. Despite an unforgettable final battle, audiences avoided the film, and it quickly faded from sight.Unfortunately, John Wayne didn't learn from 'The Last Command', and he added a love story to his 'Alamo', with the same lethargic result; Crockett's explosive demise (historically inaccurate, but rousing!) must have impressed him, as well, as he staged an even bigger version of it in his film.'The Last Command' is a curio, but is enjoyable, for the most part, and the spectacular final assault makes it a must for any action fan's collection!",17,22,False
tt0048287,A couple problems,1.0,"I found the movie to be lacking in some key areas.  For a movie to be historically based, it should be factually historically based. Some parts of the movie, like the friendship between to key figures, and the cause of the death of James Bowie, were not factually based.  One thing I was happy to note, though, was that Susanna Dickenson did really exist like the movie says.  But, being a Texan, I was very disappointed in the movie itself.",5,22,False
tt0048287,"While not historically accurate, very entertaining and well done.",9.0,"Good casting was the hallmark of this version of the Alamo. Sterling Hayden did an excellent job of playing Jim Bowie. History has changed the projection of these indomidable heroes, but the movies wouldn't be quite as popular if they portrayed Jim Bowie as an adventurer running from the law, Travis as a divorced lawyer. But Davie Crocket always manages to emerge as a real life hero. This and most other versions of the Alamo overlooks the fact that the Mexican army had just finished putting down rebellions all over Texas and the Mexican government was very generous in awarding newcomers homesteads free for the taking. But then came the Taxation, hence the rebellions of Texicans and Mexicans. The story was entertaining and left us feeling like the Alamo defenders were truly heroes.",14,21,False
tt0048287,Bean bandits and hillbillies tussel at old church,6.0,"Another in a long line of Alamo films, this one was no better than the others and they were pretty mundane. I bellowed when Davy Crockett entered the picture and it was none other than old Arthur Hunnicutt. His toothy, good natured ""howdy boys"" left me on the floor rolling. A prolific western maker, Sterling Hayden does his usual average job in a so-so movie.",8,21,False
tt0048287,Hardly the real Jim Bowie,6.0,"This is a version of the Alamo story often overlooked mainly because it focuses on Jim Bowie as opposed to Davy Crockett as the central character. Sterling Hayden in one of the many roles he truly hated before escaping to the seas is a stalwart and heroic Bowie.As I said though in another review of a film with Bowie as the central character, Jim Bowie was anything but heroic. He was a land swindler, slave dealer, no good con man who very few people had anything nice to say about. He was a tough guy though, no question about that and the famous Bowie knife was made to his specifications.Bowie was married into the Mexican aristocracy and did suffer the horrible tragedy of having his wife and children taken in an epidemic of the plague. We never see them here or in the John Wayne film or in the new Disney epic.Possibly the best acting honors do go to Arthur Hunnicutt who was more the backwoods character that Davy Crockett was then John Wayne. Billy Bob Thornton in the 2004 Alamo was probably the best Davy Crockett ever put on film and the most accurate.Probably too much is now known for the general public to appreciate a film like The Last Command. The principals at the Alamo were three dimensional characters and not the cardboard cutouts they are here.",13,20,False
tt0048287,Rousing tale of the heroes of the Alamo,9.0,"As the story goes...when John Wayne was at Republic Studioes, he approached owner Herbert J. Yates with the idea of a movie about the Alamo, in which he would play Davy Crockett. Yates turned him down and Wayne left the studio(eventually making ""The Alamo"" in 1960, on his own.) Yates, supposedly, to spite Wayne decided to make an Alamo movie.  It was probably convenient that the ""Crockett"" craze was in full bloom at the time. What resulted was a very good epic(by Republic proportions) of Jim Bowie at the Alamo. Hayden leads a magnificent cast, and Hunnicut gives us a different 'type' of Davy Crockett(maybe to spite Wayne?) Action scenes are done on a grand scale, and the drama of lost love and love found work well.  One of the better historical westerns of the 50s.",16,20,False
tt0048287,The Part John Wayne Lost,8.0,"Studio politics prevented John Wayne from getting the role he coveted.Wayne would have to wait nearly a decade before he would put his own vision of the Alamo on the silver screen. The film is magnificent and told remarkable for its era (a) with a recognition that Mr Bowie having married into the Mexican elite had become an assimilato, a naturalized Mexicano, (b) with sympathy for the Mexican viewpoint and (c) with respect for General Santa Ana. The Travis of this version is not nearly the superbly arrogant martinet of the Wayne film nor the dummy who matures in combat of the more recent edition.Regrettably unlike the Wayne film, this version omits the heroine of the story who knitted the Alamo flag-- the Mexican tricolor with the legend 1824 for the liberal constitution for which the Texans fought. Cut off by the Mexicans, the Alamo defenders would never have known of the declaration of independence or the adoption of the Lone Star flag.Yet as the story of heroism against the odds, Last Command is first rate.",16,19,False
tt0048287,Even worse than John Wayne,1.0,"It doesn't seem possible that an Alamo movie could be worse than John Wayne's great bomb, but this movie is. Sterling Hayden may be the only believable actor and just barely. The supposed 'friendship' between Bowie and Santa Anna?! But one of a host of trite disasters. Only good for a late night laugh and just barely. The physical lay out of the Alamo is not realistic, but the death of the ""Big Three"" is better than Wayne's version--although similar. It's too bad because the story of the Alamo deserved a better treatment. This script shows that it was hacked out when Wayne turned down the movie. Too bad Republic pictures didn't fold before this turkey flew or flopped!",4,18,True
tt0048287,Inaccurate history...enjoyable film!!!,8.0,"While this is another of the ""historically inaccurate"" versions of the Texas Revolution and the Battle of the Alamo, I have enjoyed watching this movie since I was a young boy. This movie, and Disney's ""Davy Crockett"", inspired a life-long passion in me to learn the truth behind the real story of the Alamo. Sterling Hayden, as Jim Bowie, is the central figure of the film. The film depicts Bowie's gradual change from loyal Mexican citizen (and good friend of Mexican leader, Santa Anna) to a leader of the Texas Revolution. While historically inaccurate, the final battle scenes of the Alamo are exciting and well-filmed. My favorite moment is a shot of Mexican infantry and cavalry charging the fort as the defenders open fire. Be sure to watch for Arthur Hunnicutt as Davy (David) Crockett...His performance, while not quite true to Crockett's character, is still fun to watch.",12,18,False
tt0048287,"Not a minute is wasted in the script, music and acting to enhance the best portrayal on screen of the two sides that confront in an unbettered action at the Alamo.",10.0,"Max Steiners stirring melodic score gives the already wonderful script and superb acting the icing on the cake to this tale of more truth than fiction. Outlining both sides of the confrontation before the final outcome. Giving reason and substance to the characters not just lifeless figureheads fighting against ghosts as in the later production. Some of the finest action sequences ever filmed in a western are in the final scenes, while the story and action keeps your attention all thru' the film, not just a wait for the end battle. The principal actors were made for the part.This film deserves a better place in noteriaty and film history.I rate this in my top ten westerns, yes maybe top five.",14,17,False
tt0048287,A victim of studio politics.,,"Commentator ""bux"" is right that John Wayne wanted to do this picture and that Republic Studio boss Herbert Yates refused.  But as I understand it, Yates nixed the idea because Wayne refused to accept his suggested co-star, the East European figureskater turned bad actress (and Yates's mistress and later wife), Vera Hruba Ralston.  It's lucky for us that they didn't agree because Wayne's own film of the Alamo in 1960, though hokey, was infinitely superior to the Republic version.",4,16,False
tt0048287,A different perspective,,"Previous posters have covered the back history of this film...some inaccurately, by the way. First of all, the Bracketville set for this film is NOT the same one used by John Wayne five years later. And WHAT a difference a few hundred miles make! Bracketville is about two hours southwest of SA, and looks NOTHING like the actual location. San Antonio is not in the desert - it's green. The SA River is basically a ditch in its natural state, not a ""majestic"" waterway. SA is at the base of the Hill Country - small rolling hills, covered ""lushly"" with green live oak trees. Disney's more recent ""The Alamo,"" while pretty bad, at least filmed in the proper terrain (albeit closer to Austin, than San Antonio).Interesting that the Alamo first appears an hour and fifteen minutes into this film. It plays a secondary role, in some aspects.(I wonder if the 1800s natives called the city ""San Antone"" as often as they do in this movie. It's not a phrase used today - it's likely to instigate derision if uttered by a tourista in 2009. It's akin to referring to ""San Francisco"" with the horrid ""Frisco""...it doesn't play well with the citizens.) Not being an historian, I can't comment on the accuracy of the film - others have covered that aspect. I will say that Hunnicutt's version of Crockett is cartoonish, at best. Most of the ""famous"" moments play in an overly-dramatic way. I suppose that is inevitable.As an aside, the reasons that Ron Howard pulled out of directing the recent version of ""The Alamo,"" are quite a story, on their own.Most historians agree that the novel, 'The Gates of the Alamo,"" is a great and accurate depiction.",9,15,False
tt0048287,Pretty good.,8.0,"This film is different from the John Wayne film ""The Alamo"" because instead of focusing on action, ""The Last Command"" focuses on the causes of the War for Texan Independence that led up to the Alamo. Because of this, the movie puts a context for the rebellion--something that wasn't all too clear in Wayne's huge epic. While not all the reasons are explored (there were Texans who wanted to bring slavery into the territory--something Mexican law did not allow), the dictatorial policies of President Santa Ana were explored. History does record that Santa Ana was a rather inept leader and he sure did do a lot to encourage the revolution--not just in Texas but in other Mexican states.Sterling Hayden plays James Bowie--the man who popularized a knife now known after him and one of the leaders at the Alamo. Unlike what I expected, Bowie was played as a very even-tempered man--a man who was initially unsure which side he was on in the war. Slowly, Bowie sees Santa Ana's excesses as justification for independence and I appreciated how he wasn't played as some macho hot-head. As far as the historical accuracy of the film, it's not easy to do a film on the life of Bowie, as there really isn't a huge amount of information about the man. Oddly, however, what history does record about Bowie is generally not discussed in the film--such as the deaths of his wife and children in the years preceding the Battle of the Alamo. But, there are no major historical flaws, either--a plus.Earlier I mentioned John Wayne's film, ""The Alamo"". While I think the Wayne film is better than most give it credit for, it is very odd that he sank so much energy and cash into making this film just five years after ""The Last Command"". And, both films are nearly equal in quality--though ""The Last Command"" cost a small fraction of the 1960 film and was a bit less long-winded--giving much more bang for the buck. ""The Alamo"" is better showing the grandness of the battle. It had a lot of extras playing Mexican soldiers, while ""The Last Command"" clearly only had a hundred or so extras dressed in Mexican uniforms in order to save money! But, ""The Last Command"" is also clearly better when it comes to portraying individuals and the reasons for the war--making it a much more personal and enjoyable film for me. The only part of the film I really disliked was the macho bull crap fight between Hayden and Ernest Borgnine near the beginning of the film--wow did that come off as stupid!",10,13,False
tt0048287,Good Action Film,,"Frankly, I don't watch movies expecting to see historical accuracy. Movies are basically a commercial product marketed to earn a profit, which means pleasing as large an audience as possible. So, if there's a conflict between historical accuracy and constructing a more saleable story, we know generally which factor will prevail. That's simply the way our capitalistic system works. Thus, well-intended folks should not be surprised at the liberties taken in this supposed account of events surrounding the siege of the Alamo.That being said, I thought the movie was very enjoyable. I thought so back in 1955, and again the other night on TMC. It's a good lively cast. Hayden may not have liked his role, but he's motivated nonetheless—catch how much he puts into the emotional exhaustion when he raps in vain on a door and then faces the camera in near collapse. That's probably the most animated this fan of Hayden's has seen him in any movie. The under-rated Richard Carlson also delivers as Hayden's rival, and of course there's the inspired casting of Hunnicutt as Davy Crockett at a time when Disney's Crockett dominated the big screen and the pop music charts too. In fact, Hunnicutt's little speech after arriving at the fort amounts to a masterpiece of down-home eloquence. And Russell Simpson's parson of-very-few- words is just the kind of no-nonsense character you'd expect to find among a band of back- woodsmen. Too bad, however, that commercial factors required Alberghetti's role. She's fine as the teenage aristocrat, but the sub-plot pairing her with the very mature Hayden amounts to the movie's biggest drawback. One thing lowly Republic was good at is action sequences. Here the battle scenes and spectacle are outstanding—the collapsing parapet is both surprising and especially well done. For sure, the studio knew how to get the most out of limited resources, even as constraints show up around the edges, particularly with painted backdrops. Nonetheless, the enemy is treated with due respect, and I particularly liked the elegiac final scene with the traumatized women and children. It's just the kind of somber mood fitting for what has happened. Of course, Republic's reputation as a cowboy studio would never get its product much attention from either the press or the artistic community. Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly well-mounted and entertaining feature that can hold its own against bigger- budget action features of its day. Too bad, its many merits have been so generally overlooked.",11,12,False
tt0048287,"""The Last Command"" is better than average despite the budget",,"Old time director and Hollywood pioneer Frank Lloyd made his final picture (""The Last Command"") for Republic Pictures and he didn't have much of a budget to work with. Luckily, Lloyd knew his craft well and got the maximum effects he could despite the monetary restrictions. ""The Last Command"" is about the fall of the Alamo in 1836 and the main character is Jim Bowie (Sterling Hayden). Hayden supposedly hated this movie and his role in it, but then, Hayden hated nearly all his movies and all his roles, so it's all irrelevant. In fact, he does a fine job as Bowie and carries the film with his riveting performance. Also on hand are Arthur Hunnicut as a very backwoods-type Davy Crockett and Richard Carlson in the thankless role of the stuff-shirted Colonel William Travis. A young and attractive Anna Marie Alberghetti provides the love interest for Hayden and Ernest Borgnine also stars as one of the Alamo's more ferocious defenders. Rounding out the cast is J. Carrol Naish as a somewhat sympathetic General Santa Anna. The real Generalissimo was a ruthless scoundrel who was noted for executing defenseless prisoners; why he's portrayed here as a congenial fellow is beyond the limits of any historical truth. Also stretching reality is the film's depiction of Bowie and Santa Anna as long lost buddies. Despite these obvious plot line gaffes, the action sequences are brilliantly staged by director Lloyd and will satisfy most fans of the genre. Hayden went on to more complicated roles in his career, but according to his biographers, he mostly preferred sailing on his yacht with a well-stocked liquor cabinet. He never cared about his status in Hollywood and consequently his career never attained the heights that many had predicted for him. It's too bad he didn't get the chance to play the real Jim Bowie. That fellow was a slave-trading knife-wielding reckless adventurer who specialized in duels, Indian fighting and deadly barroom brawls. A nice guy he wasn't. As for the rest of the participants of this film, Anna Maria Alberghetti never became a huge star either, but she's still active in the business. Arthur Hunnicut enjoyed a long and successful career in both films and television. Of course, Ernest Borgnine's career has been near-legendary and he remains one of Hollywood's most formidable stars to this day.",10,11,True
tt0048287,Beautifu color and beautiful music ...seldom in one place,10.0,"I saw ""The Last Command"" twice in my hometown at the theater in 1955.

The three exceptions to that point of view, are three truly great movies: ""The Last Command"", ""Rio Bravo"" and ""Big Jake""...in any order you choose.In 1997, I bought the commercial video of ""The Last Command"" and still have it.

Unlike the 2004 film,this too had the battle of the Alamo fought in the daylight and not at night. But Hayden at least was the same size as the real Jim Bowie.The real Bowie was about 6 feet 6 as was Hayden.

tt0048287,Minor epic holds up well,,"Made in spite by Yates, well shot and mounted, replete with an excellent cast, 'The Last Command' still remains good value even if it rather pales besides Wayne's grandiose epic of just a few years later. The much underrated Hayden is superb as ""big Jim Bowie"" and Hunnicutt equally as good as Davy Crockett. Hayden has the ability to appear gentle, naive, rugged and brusque all at once - something few other actors, with perhaps the exception of Spencer Tracy, managed. Unfortunately Crockett and his 29 men don't appear until some way in. With only Hayden's latent dynamism really keeping things afloat, the first half an hour of the film is rather talkative in exposition, and it drags somewhat. Consuela de Quesada (Anna Marie Alberghetti) is a limp romantic foil to Bowie - I for one would be happy to have seen her written out and the structure tightened through her absence. Ernest Borgnine plays his small role with gusto - his confrontation with Bowie a standout scene in a film full of fighting, although his later genial acceptance of Bowie's superiority as a man is perhaps emphasised by the script too much for comfort.Steiner's music (and especially the superb title song) goes a long way in making events move smoothly towards the climax. For it's the Alamo Battle the bums on seats will have come to see, and here it is done well (although again not *as* well as Wayne would manage with considerable more time and resources later (although any comparison isn't too much to the present film's detriment).In short this is well worth seeing, and it provides a contemporarily staged contrast to the better-known epic which was to follow. I'd still like to see an historically accurate account of the events at the mission, though...",8,10,False
tt0048287,Republic Pictures take on the Alamo legend.,6.0,"Forget any adherence to historical facts, directed by Frank Lloyd and with a Warren Duff screenplay, The Last Command is a slow moving piece that uses Jim Bowie as its focal point. Starring Sterling Hayden (Bowie), Richard Carlson (William Travers), Arthur Hunnicutt (Davy Crockett), Ernest Borgnine (Mike Radin), J. Carrol Naish (Santa Ana), and Anna Maria Alberghetti (Consuela), the piece was a project long courted by John Wayne. However, Republic refused to sanction the type of budget the Duke wanted for his vision. So after offering him a nominal fee for a part, he refused and Republic promptly went on to make the film anyway. The final result is an interesting film that finally pays off for those having the patience and tolerance for patriotic flag waving.The story follows the battle of the Alamo in San Antonio in 1836, where brave Texans gave their life to become free of the Mexican rule, by defending the former mission station against overwhelming odds as the Mexican army of Santa Ana closed in for victory. The final battle is very well staged by Lloyd, and the acting, though not making the earth move, is very competent, particularly Hayden who does a nice line in tortured ruggedness. Max Steiner provides a zippy score and the low budget use of Trucolor doesn't affect the work of cinematographer Jack Marta. Safe and enjoyable as a story telling piece, if ultimately far from being a rousing spectacle fit for that particular part in history. 6/10",9,9,False

After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit naïve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.

Then you'll enjoy this film. I, unlike a lot of fans, will not claim that this is a move masterpiece, I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I, however, will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema, when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now, at first, I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists, so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it, on DVD, and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning, Lycans (Werewolves) vrs. Vampires, is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil, it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying, after falling in love with this film, to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up, there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film, this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history, their is a false history, their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters, as they would be in real life, with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending, the promise of more characters from the past.

tt0320691,Can't wait for the sequel!,8.0,"I have just watched Underworld for the second time, and I was gratified to discover that it was every bit as good as I remembered - if not more so. No two ways about it; this is one terrific movie.The action scenes and some of the special effects could be better, but the movie has utterly superb style, mood, plot and acting! The story itself is probably the best vampire-slash-werewolf story I've encountered (though admittedly I don't know many, as I'm not really a horror fan), and the ending is just fabulous.I also just love the thing about the chief vampires sleeping for predetermined periods of time, and are then revived - this is incredibly cool.And the whole thing is borne aloft by the great skill of the British lead actors - particularly hard-hitting cutie Kate Beckinsale, wild-eyed Michael Sheen and that late bloomer of a genuine acting icon, Bill Nighy, who gives an unflinching performance.It won't be long now till Underworld: Evolution comes out - and I'm just thrilled at the prospect of seeing more of this stylish world! If they can fulfill my expectations of the sequel, I will be making an upward correction of my rating of this movie from 8 to 9, because then we'll have a larger universe which makes sense in a larger context. That's how a good movie franchise should function.Crossing fingers!",71,107,False
tt0320691,Features on the 2 Disc DVD Make It the Way to Go,,"The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to, can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.",71,97,False
tt0320691,Underworld. A new legend is born.,10.0,"Let me start this review by saying that, while this work is NOT scary, it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of ""Horror,"" strictly due to the ""monster"" factor. There are ""tense"" moments, to be sure, but this is not a ""boo!"" kind of movie. There is; however, plenty of action, lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects, the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish ""mansion,"" the gritty tension held throughout the movie, and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.The effects were so well done, they were believable. They explain that the older Lycan can change at will, regardless of the moon's cycle...with that in mind, the way the werewolves' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON. Changing at will would BE like that, especially in times of anger or great stress. Someone (possibly Wiseman?) had heard (and correctly believed) that ""less is more,"" because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not...simply more Hollywood ""Matrix"" flash. These scenes were so well done; so well directed, filmed and portrayed that we could, even if for a short time, believe the things we were watching...were possible. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. It reminded me if the horribly campy western/vampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled, ""Sundown,"" where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets.I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director. I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man. (He was also one of the writers of the original literary work.) If this is his first attempt, we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg. Personally, I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock. The weaponry Selene (Kate Beckinsale) utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater. When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan; when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles, was absolutely excellent. AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of ""The Matrix."" The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies, and frankly, I just don't see it. Also, ""Blade"" has been used as a source of comparison. The only similarities between ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" are that Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of ""Pure Bloods,"" uses a sword. Oh, and there are Vampires. Those were the ONLY common points, as far as I could tell. This is an original work; not a petty rip-off or a ""jumble of other movies."" This is a very creative and unique attempt; a successful one, if you ask me. While guns were used more than I would have liked, the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard action-flick fare. One of the vampire ""Death Dealers"" uses a pair of 10' whips quite well. And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned...what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power. The costumes were kept simple, yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood. Two words...understated elegance. Absolutely brilliant. Some have said that the story line is hard to follow, or that there is no discernible plot. Let me be frank. This is not a movie for the squeamish, nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot. Sure, there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained, but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather. The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman) is well written and pleasantly portrayed, in the midst of all that darkness and drama. A bit of candle-light to shine hope into the darkness of despair, as it were. The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic, with enough additional plot and sub-plot to keep even the most common movie-goer interested. The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years. The Lycan, once the serving class to the Vampire, had risen against their masters and won their freedom. But was that the real story? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long? In the center of this war are Selene (Vampire) and Michael (Lycan). Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written, but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love? As one of the chosen ""Death Dealers,"" an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans, Selene is faced with a decision most dire: sell out and live? or be true to herself and die? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice? And that is where the sub-plot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say, ""Oh wow! No kidding?!"" at the darkling twists in the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this work, and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection. Superb acting; rich depth of character; talented, creative directing; and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies, for me. It earns an ambitious 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",58,91,True

Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin, a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done, despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brooding, which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting, using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age (such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver).  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel, and the sequel should follow ""Underworld"" with real impact as well.",59,83,False
tt0320691,"Expect Nothing, get a little more",6.0,"I enjoyed Underworld. I expected it to be absurd, awful, plot-less and pointless. While it is certainly not the most brilliant and original story, nor does it teem with insight about the human condition, its not awful, its plot heavy, and it really isn't pointless. It's just a tad absurd, though.This is the story of a human (Scott Speedman) entangled in a six hundred year old war between vampires and werewolves, and the vampire death dealer (Beckinsale) whose compassion for him permits her to seek the truth in ways that few of her species have before.The acting is of variable quality. Kate Beckinsale is wonderfully cute, and does a pretty fair job of acting when she's not doing a Keanu Reeves/Neo impression. Michael Sheen provides a great supporting performance. Shane Brolly isn't really up to the task, in my opinion.The script is good, although it's full of clichés. The editing and directing are both impeccable, and help to move everything along at an entertaining and brisk pace.This is a fun action-oriented film, with stylish darkness and enough originality to make it worth seeing.

Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. This Vamp-Werewolf model make explanations easy, rather than requiring long prologues or in-depth discussions. The whole 'virus' idea is logical, and easy to follow. It's slick, modern, fast-paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high-tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. I'm a real fan of the whole colour scheme, with few colours used in any one shot, and blues used for almost everything, keeping it looking cool, and sleek. I am also a Kate Beckinsale fan, and I love Action films that don't use women like an extra person to shout 'watch out!' or hit someone over the head.

tt0320691,This movie was a complete BUST,1.0,"Underworld was a travesty.A complete and utter travesty.This movie was touted as featuring a battle between werewolves and vampires. Yet the movie rarely saw any real combat besides overly clichéd gun battles. The plot, for much of the movie is non-existent. Werewolves were once slaves to vampires until one werewolf (just a side note werewolves are called Lycans in this film, by the way) took a vampire for a bride. Her father, Viktor, kills his own daughter and makes Lucian, the Lycan in question, watch. This starts the war. Mainly cause Viktor feared the creation of a Lycan-Vampire mixed breed.All this comes out in about the last ten to fifteen minutes or so of the movie by the way.Meanwhile, we have Selene, a 'Death Dealer' (a vampire who hunts werewolves), who hunts them out of revenge, falling in love with Michael Corvin (I'm having flashbacks to the hideous Crow 3 here folks, even if the guy's last name IS from Crow 2) who's the descendant of some guy named Corvinus or something like that. Supposedly he has the potential to become both vamp and Lycan. Which he does.And yet in the end it's SELENE who kills off Viktor, who had killed her family 600 years prior to the events of the film. This is another clichéd plot twist. I mean come on. ""Werewolves killed my family, so I kill them to satiate my lust for vengeance against werewolves who may have already been killed anyway."" Yeah, who the hell DIDN'T see that coming by the time this movie was ended? Seriously, show of hands.Any takers? No? Good for you. It's too completely obvious.Here's the kicker. Lucian (Lucien?) has been trying to turn himself into a cross-breed Lycan-Vamp, which would make him more powerful than either race. Well, as you might expect, Michael gets bitten by a Lycan. Goes through most of the movie having 'hallucinations' which are actually Lucian's memories of what started the war between the two races. Gets shot and nearly dies because of some idiot SOB (who is Viktor's second in command of course.), gets bitten by Selene, and becomes the hybrid Viktor is so afraid of seeing come into existence. Cue the only DECENT fight scene in this movie. Viktor and Michael go at it pretty well. It looks like it's going to become the sole redeeming quality in this movie. Then Viktor gets Michael in a headlock. (Hey, when did this turn into a wrestling match?) Guess what. Selene gets involved and slices Viktor's head in half diagonally.Making the concept that Michael is supposed to be more powerful than both Lycans and Vampires (and let me point out here that Lycans in this film are also supposed to be immortal once changed, and that all either race has to do is a simple bite.), abso-fricking-lutely POINTLESS! Whoever wrote this movie must have been on crack. I mean it. The story was contrived, the 'fight scenes' shallow except for Michael vs. Viktor, and they actually managed to RUIN that fight by having Selene get in the killing blow. This type of flagrant sexism in horror movies in which the villain/monster/alien from beyond/whatever almost always dies at the hands of a woman has always dragged down my enjoyment of most horror flicks in general, and utterly annoys me throughout Underworld as Selene is like a female Blade in reverse with NONE of the potential that Blade has to be in potential danger even if he's just faking it. I never get the impression that Selene is in any way harmable because she's far too much like Blade mixed with the Punisher mixed with Daredevil. She also is the driving force of this film, which means that Michael, whom she's supposed to be in love with, and who, from the apparent standpoint of the movie, is supposed to be the character around which all of this utter stinkbomb revolves, is little more than a footnote, and appears in barely a quarter of the movie. He is more or less just a helpless idiot throughout most of the film. Then, they remove any power and presence his transformation is supposed to give him by not only having Viktor in a position to kill him, which should have ended with Viktor's hold being broken by Michael's supposedly superior strength speed and power, but by having him be rescued by Selene, who has basically been the only character who really DOES -anything- in this entire movie.I put off buying Underworld for almost two years because I was wary of it. Mostly because of the way I disliked the werewolf costumes in the trailers. I will admit, I have come to like the werewolf suits, but not enough to consider them a saving grace of the film.This film managed to ruin the one thing which could have redeemed it in my eyes. And sadly, it hints at a possible sequel at the end with another of the Vampires who is supposedly as old as Marcus and possibly a halfbreed himself taking over as the main villain. Which means this pile of utter waste is likely going to have a baby brother.Avoid it at all costs folks. This movie was a bomb.

tt0320691,Should be a comic book,9.0,"For all I know, there could already be a comic book in the works for the vampire-werewolf fantasy, ""Underworld.""  I just got back from seeing it and I must say that this movie should stand up pretty well in the face of all the ridiculous (read: pointless, useless) ""Matrix; Crow; Blade"" comparisons. I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true, I don't really care; this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.  ""Underworld"" really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought, but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people, are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets, highly Victorian as they are, also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book; I can tell. It certainly has the look, feel, and story of one, yet that still doesn't make it bad.  Speaking of the story, though it isn't strong, it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing, even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still, it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.As for the action scenes, they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly, there isn't that much gore here either.  But what is really surprising is that the movie doesn't offer us pointless action scenes to fill in for lack of story; there's actually meaning behind it all.""Underworld"" is a pretty well-done fantasy that deserves to be immortalized in the comics.9/10",32,57,False
tt0320691,Not Good At All,1.0,"*Minor Spoilers - don't worry, you spot them coming a mile away*Some of the fights were decent. The morphing thing on the werewolves was good. The costumes were interesting, if not a tad redundant, and the setting kept very gothic and fitting for most of the film.That is where the virtues of this film end.We have been waiting almost ten years for another decent vampire movie, and we keep getting cliched disappointment after another. Vampire culture barely factored into it. We hardly see them demonstrate any of their powers. This could very easily be about human werewolf-hunters, and the plot would need only a little tweaking. That aside, the plot was still quite bad. The avenging-murdered-family bit is getting very old and very tired and it's pulled off in uncreative enough a way not to give them the benefit of the doubt.When Selene (Beckinsale) and Mike (Speedman) inevitably fall in love, you begin to wonder why, as nothing has really happened that merits any feelings for one another. Their first kiss comes from out of nowhere. I realize this is primarily an action movie but let's put SOMETHING behind the relationships.That being said, the action sequences that were rewarding to watch were few and far between, and none of them involved Selene. Kate Beckinsale seems very out of place in a fight. And in the final battle, the death of the big bad guy is actually very comical, and the cinema I was in burst into laughter when he died, which I somehow doubt was the intent.;And finally, as a horror film, it doesn't even try to scare you. I can't see it being considered a horror film in any serious capacity.And as a detail, why didn't we just call them ""Werewolves"" instead of ""Lycans"" which sounds exactly like ""Lichens.""",24,54,True
tt0320691,I have been mugged at the movies!,1.0,"I am stunned and horrified to read the comments on this movie.I can scarcely find words to describe how badly this movie stinks. I can only assume that many of the US reviewers were fooled by a bunch of English accents and dreary shots of a dismal Eastern-European city into thinking that this was somehow a classy piece of work.Beckinsale was a leather clad plank - I felt no sympathy or empathy for her character simply because her character did not exist - she was just speaking a few words.In fact this applies to damn near everyone else in this mess. There were virtually no character building moments at all - we just have no idea who these 2-dimensional S&M fetish-freaks are at all.There is no plot to speak of - all we need to know is laid out wholesale in the opening monotone monologue. If the director had not been so keen to slap his now-fiancee up on screen at every opportunity, he might have realised that there was a story to tell - that of the unwitting human caught in the middle of events he doesn't understand. Had we seen the story through his eyes we would have been shocked at the initial battle and surprised as the extent of the 'underworld' is revealed to us. Quite simply the director is telling the wrong story.Instead the movie treats the audience like bunch of slack-jawed morons and spoon feeds us the whole story up front just so we don't have to worry our pretty little heads with such nasty complicated stuff as plot.Okay. I love vampire movies. All of them Nosferatu, right through to Blade, and I'm pretty sure that in all of these pretty much the whole point is that vampires are like, *evil* and, you know, *drink blood*.Wearing a bit of leather bondage tat and moping around a big old house at night does not make you a vampire. Where was the blood-sucking? We barely even saw a set of fangs - these were simply the most boring vampires I've ever seen.The werewolves were a bit better, but the CGI was very poor and the man-to-sort of mutant pig-gorilla thing transformation is totally eclipsed by twenty year old classics like American Werewolf and The Howling.The less said about the noise which passes for a soundtrack the better. In fact I've said too much already. So I'll stop.I hated this film so much I can't even be bothered to rant about it any more.Go see this film if you want leave feeling like someone hit you over the head and stole your money - or just find a dark street and wait to be mugged for a similar, but possibly more entertaining experience.",24,53,False
tt0320691,Gothic Gangster Movie Kills.,8.0,"""Underworld"" culls two races from mythology, vampires and werewolves, and has them co-existing in the same setting. While the two are staples of the horror genre (""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man""), this doesn't play out like a traditional horror movie. This action packed story will please horror fans and convert new ones due to the melding of movie types to create a fresh interpretation to a century old genre.A male human (Scott Speedman) unwittingly becomes involved in an on going war between vampires and werewolves. When a female vampire (Kate Beckinsale) notices the werewolves following this human, she becomes suspicious and begins to investigate why he is so important, even if it changes everything she has ever known about her life and vampire history.This monster movie follows the age-old traditions established in the early novels (by Bram Stoker) and movies (""Werewolf Of London"") featuring vampires and lycanthropes. Of late, there's been some wanna-be trendy, horror movies that have thrown the standards out the window. Those standards are comforting and we, the audience, expect to see them. Vampires deteriorate in sunlight leading to instant death. Werewolves can only be killed by a silver bullet. ""Underworld"" takes these traditions, builds on them and makes them their own.While it reads as a horror, it plays more like a gangster movie. Both races participate in gunplay with specially modified bullets to instantly kill their opponents. The werewolves are brutish goons, wanna-be gangsters with more brawn than brains. On the flip side, the vampires are like a communal family with hierarchy, ancient customs and they're legitimate business owners which funds their criminal endeavours.Due to the aforementioned gunplay, this is more violent than gory. It's still bloody but there are no scenes that'll make you queasy or nauseous. The violence is another reason why it has a gangster feel about it.There's a class system subtext that runs through this movie. The lower class werewolves battling the upper class vampires. Working class is possibly a better adjective for the werewolves. They are masculine, unkempt and unsophisticated. On the other hand, the gothic vampires are immaculately dressed with a expensive sense of style. They lounge around looking glamourous as if they're supermodels at a cocktail party. Opulence and high class is the style the production and costume designer has given these blood suckers.Beckinsale's quite fetching in her erotic, PVC, full body costume. Her bondage like outfit's more interesting than her intentionally emotionless performance. One wonders why she didn't keep her British accent as the cast is made up of international actors with a pot-pourri of different brogues? It's good to see her in a lead role, above the title credit, where she holds her own portraying a strong, forceful character. Of late, she's played the glorified girlfriend part (eg. Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor""). Here, she's independent, without a partner to justify her significance. While this is the kind of role a man would normally play, she's still feminine and sexy without having to show any flesh.Bill Nighy has a supporting role as an elder vampire who's resurrected before his time in order to help Beckinsale. Nighy's rightfully become popular in the last few years. He's adept in any part he plays even a centuries-old vampire with superhuman strength. His climatic fight scene never draws unintentional laughs which shows what a convincing actor he is.The other name star of this movie is Bacardi. Product placement is rife during the opening sequence in an underground train station. This is quite surprising when you watch the entire movie.Never at any time is there any indication where and when this movie is set. The gothic architecture and vehicle licence plates have you thinking that this could be somewhere in Europe. There are no title cards, characters speak with differing accents and there are no recognizable landmarks used as locations. All we do know is is that where ever they are they have Bacardi. If the moviemakers were trying to create a nondescript world, alien from our own, then why use blatant product placement for Bacardi?The colour film stock has been manipulated intentionally to give a blue hue to it. This reinforces the gothic style of the movie. Blue isn't just a colour, it's also an emotion. It's constantly raining which adds to the cold look the cinematographer and production designer have created. These races are unemotional people which also strengthens the blue tone.Computer generated visual effects were used for the movie which is far removed from John Landis' ""An American Werewolf In London"". While the special effects are impressive, there is no mystery into how they were achieved. Special effects and make up were a real art form before the days of CGI. These technicians are a dying breed due to computers. It's a shame that moviemakers rely heavily on CGI as it's slowly becoming run of the mill.Overall, ""Underworld""'s a good action/horror/gangster movie with a strong female lead. This hybrid is filled with polished set pieces and seamless CGI. There's talk that this is the first of a proposed trilogy and I hope the next two will be as strong as this.",25,44,True
tt0320691,Worst cinematic experience in a very long time.,1.0,"I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature, why didn't they drink blood and, as others have pointed out, how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn, they are still vulnerable to sun-light, but there isn't any during the whole film.Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was, that everybody ended up killing each other.I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying, that there will be a show-down in the end. Let me just say that they should really, really have used a stand-in/stunt-man for poor old Viktor. So in order to make this film a good experience you really have to stop thinking and just drift with it - and this was simply impossible for me.regards SimonPs.

Oh, you thought vampires were really the undead?

tt0320691,"Nice, underrated movie",,"I am surprised to find that at the time I cast my rating, this movie only got a 6.3/10. I think it is actually much more entertaining than that. First of all, this flick has what seem to be novel ideas in it, in particular the introduction of a kind of ""kinship"" between humans, vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans in the movie). I don't intend to give away spoilers, but let me just say that there is a really surprising twist in the second half of the movie. When you go through the first half, you think that the plot has been given away too early. But to my delight, this was not the case, due to the surprise twist I mentioned earlier. The story can be viewed as a metaphor for racial conflicts and prejudices that exist among humans and it pictures how senseless hatred is borne from generation to generation through cover-ups, deceit and misinformation, and how heavy sacrifices have to be made to bring end to conflict and reach some peace agreement or truce. The action sequences in the movie were also quite decent, although not quite up to the standards of movies in The Matrix trilogy. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely perfect for the role of the female vampire Selene. I must say she looks stunning in her movie hairdo and she is totally hot in the tight black vampiress latex attire. Bill Nighy (who recently played Billy Mack in the feel good X-mas movie ""Love Actually"") has also been aptly cast as the powerful vampire overlord Viktor. He plays convincingly as the hate-mongering bigot of a leader who is willing to do anything to perpetuate the enmity and hatred of the vampires towards the Lycans. The only weakness I found in this movie is the rather anti-climactic ending. But, highly recommended nonetheless.I give it 8/10.",16,29,True
tt0030044,Errol Flynn's Best Performance,,"The Dawn Patrol - based on a book my John Monk Saunders is the story of a RFC squadron in France during the Great War. If has three good central performances - Basil Rathbone showing an array of hyper tense emotions - David Niven changing from a happy go lucky drunken fool to a hardened leader of men and the best, by far, Errol Flynn as a guilt ridden hero whose nerves are torn to shreds.Flynn has had so much bad press over the years and people forget that he was a great actor in the early days. This film demonstrates that superbly. There are no women in this film, no distractions. It's about men up against it, and having to watch their comrades die needlessly against overwhelming odds.The film has moments of silence, laughter, terror all mixed together with some superb skewed camera angles in the mess to give a feeling of drunken hopelessness. Flynn's relief at seeing Niven when he thought he was dead is a moving performance. His quiet moments when he talks about England, his control when trying to convince Nivens younger brother to go up for the first time - these scenes show real presence and talent. You feel for him and all around him. Coming out just before the beginning of WW2 it would have given the home audiences great understanding of what they faced - a hard and bloody task, where young men will die as surely as the older ones will order them to fight.This film should be reissued on DVD and shown around the world - it's that good. Let's write some more scripts like this and start making some decent films again.",57,61,False
tt0030044,Flynn shines in serious drama of WWI aviators...,7.0,"DAWN PATROL was a forerunner of the ""men facing war"" kind of dramas that became a steady source of entertainment in books and films of the decades that followed, particularly after WWII.But this takes place during World War I in 1915, when aviation was still young and men in the flying machines were sent into battle against greater odds than anyone could imagine.Basil Rathbone plays the commander breaking under pressure who has to see young men under his command die in battle against the Germans. He is delighted to be relieved of his command by the young flier who has been chiding him for sending inexperienced men into battle--Errol Flynn. Flynn soon finds himself hounded by the same sort of pressures facing Rathbone. His best friend (David Niven) is a fun loving pal who has a change of heart when his younger brother (well played by Morton Lowry), turns up for immediate duty despite a scant amount of training. Under Flynn's orders, the boy goes into battle the following day and is killed. This event sets up the dramatic conclusion which has Flynn willing to sacrifice himself and single-handedly take on a most dangerous mission across enemy lines.Edmund Goulding keeps the story going from one excellent scene to another and all of the performances are first rate. Donald Crisp is less stuffy than usual in a good supporting role.But it's Errol Flynn who makes the strongest impression in a role that calls for some fine moments of acting. His emotions seem genuine and his performance is crisp and mature. Indeed, one of his best performances in a well written role.The ultimate message of the film is the anguish and futility of war and it comes across without being preachy. Definitely a Flynn film that is well worth watching.",36,37,False
tt0030044,One of the very best of all war films,10.0,"The Dawn Patrol, one of Director Eddie Goulding's very finest, is as tense and tightly wound as the characters it portrays, who face the awful question, 'what is maximum effort', how much can a man give in combat before breaking? The story revolves around the vividly drawn characters of Lt. Scott,'Scotty', played by David Niven in one of his  most genuine performances, and that of his chum, Captain Courtney,   well played by Errol Flynn. Together the two friends face death each day in machines held together by 'spit and baling wire' and each night drink themselves into oblivion. Their antics contrast with the concern that is eating at their commanding officer, Major Brand, wonderfully portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Brand is  visibly cracking under the strain, while the oblivious Courtney and Scott play at war, seemingly unconcerned by death or anything else. Paired with Brand is the unflappable Phipps, presented by stalwart character actor Donald Crisp. It is Crisp, who is finally made to express the film's underlying anti-war theme, questioning the point of sending all the fine young men to their deaths, ""...and for what?"", he asks though no answer is forthcoming. The tension is expertly broken by comic interludes of genuine hilarity as well as great scenes of World War air combat. One sees a reflection of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game', when a German pilot, who is thought to have killed Scotty, is brought in to meet Courtney, who shot him down and they show each other the mutual respect and chivalry that still crossed the no-mans land between the two sides. Like '12 0'Clock High'its World War II counterpart, this film puts the viewer under the skins of these men as they face death. No phony posturing or heroics, no masks, just humanity faced with something which, ultimately is inhuman. This intelligent and questioning film is at the very top of my list of great war films, and is an absolute must see for new generations of movie goers.",32,36,False
tt0030044,"Exciting & Anguishing Film About ""the next man who dies""",10.0,"I first saw this movie when I was 16, and didn't understand a lot of its subtleties; I just thought it was an exciting & dramatic war film with a lot of great flying sequences. I caught it again when I was 34 and was surprised at its depth.I like to watch this movie whenever my own job gets crazy and hectic, with unrealistic deadlines and insufficient support, because it reminds me that I really don't have it so bad after all. The men in this movie were sent up daily in obsolete equipment in a bad state of disrepair; as the film progressed the squadron had about a 70% turnover as the combat veterans were shot down and replaced by green kids whose limited training could not possibly have prepared them for what they would face.The characters are all dissected, even lesser, supporting roles receive excellent character studies, and the stars of course are downright fascinating. It's a thrill to learn that Errol Flynn (Captain Courtney) really could act, as well as just jump around and wave a sword; David Niven is wonderfully innocent and almost childlike as ""Scotty,"" and Basil Rathbone, a truly great actor who seldom got the chance to strut his stuff since he was usually typecast as a ""bad guy"" or as Sherlock Holmes, gives a nerve-wrenching performance as Major Brand, who's floundering under the strain. He proves a profound point -- it is often easier to go to your own death than to order others to do so, a lesson Captain Courtney and Lt. Scott must reluctantly learn as well.I'm now 44, and have seen this movie a couple dozen times, but it never ages. The flying sequences are still exciting; the chivalry and wild antics of the fliers never becomes tiresome or old, and the anguish of war is still as heartbreaking.

tt0030044,Flynn in Excellent Drama of WWI Aviators...,,"THE DAWN PATROL, Errol Flynn's final film of his busiest year as an actor (1938), is a fascinating counterpoint to his usual swashbuckling and light comic roles. A remake of Howard Hawks' 1930 classic, this is a tale of war-weary WWI aviators, called upon to risk their lives daily, in broken-down aircraft, on missions they consider impossible (a timeless war theme that would reappear in such WWII classics as COMMAND DECISION and TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH). Directed by WWI veteran Edmund Goulding, best known for his big-budget romances (GRAND HOTEL), the film counterpoints the gritty, harsh realities on the ground with the nearly surreal quality of early air battles, as bi-planes with open cockpits whirl and swoop like insects, and enemy airmen would occasionally drop out possessions of dead pilots over airfields, in a chivalrous gesture.Fellow pilots Courtney and Scott (portrayed by real-life friends Flynn and David Niven, again showing the rapport they had demonstrated so effectively in 1936's THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE) are battle-tested veterans, hell-raising survivors of a squadron decimated by the war. Seeing a constant influx of 'green' kids replacing lost friends, and knowing too well that the rookies' inexperience will quickly cost them their lives, the pair vent their anger against their commander, the coldly 'by-the-book' Maj. Brand (in a remarkable performance by frequent Flynn nemesis, Basil Rathbone). Courtney constantly condemns and belittles Maj. Brand, accusing him of placing 'The Mission' over the lives of the men under his command, which makes Courtney a hero in the eyes of the fliers.Finally, Brand cracks, and is approved for reassignment, and Courtney is chosen to replace him. In a powerful scene, Brand lets his cold 'facade' down, and reveals, bitterly, to the younger man that seeing his men sent on suicide missions, daily, had literally crushed him. Unknown to the squadron, Brand had constantly begged HQ to ease up, but had been 'shot down' each time, as the missions were essential. ""Now it's YOUR turn,"" Brand sneers, ""See how YOU enjoy it!""Brand's words are prophetic, as Courtney quickly discovers himself in the same situation, as the despised scapegoat, with Scott assuming the role of spokesperson and savior to the squadron. And the most dangerous mission yet has just come down from HQ...DAWN PATROL is a powerful film, with great performances from the entire cast, particularly Flynn, who had often begged the WB to give him roles beyond his 'swashbuckler' image. The critical praise it garnered proved Flynn's versatility as an actor (although public demand would keep him 'locked' into adventure films), and raised David Niven up to 'star' status.It remains one of the BEST films about the 'Great War', and shouldn't be missed!",29,32,False
tt0030044,Since the aerial stuff was already done.............................,8.0,"Warner Brothers more than most of the other major studios had a habit of simply recycling the old plots of their films and repackaging them. A good example would be the boxing film Kid Galahad remade a few years later as The Wagons Roll at Night with the setting now changed to a circus. But in this case we didn't get a remake of The Dawn Patrol, we got practically a carbon copy.I finally saw the original The Dawn Patrol that was made in 1930 by Howard Hawks and found that this film was practically a word for word remake of the Hawks classic. Of course it was no surprise to learn that all the aviation sequences were just lifted bodily from the first film, but probably more than that was done. Several long-shots looked exactly the same.In a way this might have worked out because director Edmund Goulding who was not known for action films could concentrate on the actors and he got very good performances out of Errol Flynn, David Niven, and Basil Rathbone who step into the parts that Richard Barthelmess, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Neil Hamilton did the first time around.Still after seeing first one version, than the other, one might be complaining of double vision at that.",29,31,False
tt0030044,Basil's Satisfactory Revenge On Errol,10.0,"I have often felt that had history been kinder there would have been no major wars affecting the globe after 1918. The pacifist spirit that hit most of the states in the west was due to the size of the casualty rates suffered by the major states in the war. It was sufficient to cause massive re-considerations by the U.S., England, and France about military cut-backs, and (in fact) in 1921 the Washington Naval Conference did lead to the top allied powers (six actually - they included little Belgium) to reduce the size of their navies were based on proportions. In 1925 there was a ""spirit of Locarno"" as France and Germany under Aristide Briand and Gustave Stresseman began a road to rapprochement. In 1928 Briand and U.S. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg created the Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawing warfare (which is still used as the basis for war crimes trials).Of course the rise of Fascist, Nazi, and Communist regimes and the great depression wrecked the entire pacifist movement. Mussolini, Hitler, and the Japanese felt pacifist views mirrored weakness, and dismissed them. And the resulting war of 1939 - 1945 was more bloody and horrifying than the Great War had been. And even that war has not been the last one of the 20th or 21st Centuries.One reflection of the pacifism and hatred of war is found in the movies and plays of the inter-war years, like THE ROAD TO GLORY which showed the bloodshed and uselessness of the trench warfare in France (it is worthy to watch that film with PATHS OF GLORY to see how hopeless that trench warfare was). Other films like this were JOURNEY'S END, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK, and this film, DAWN PATROL.DAWN PATROL tells the story of a British aerodrome on the western front. It is commanded by Major Brand (Basil Rathbone - in one of his most human roles). Brand's two best fighter pilots are Captain Courtney (Errol Flynn) and Lieutenant Scott (David Niven). Both of them tend to create there own rules but they do a spectacular job at fighting the Germans effectively. Rathbone, however, has dozens of other young pilots who are sent to the aerodrome, but become fodder for the German fighter pilots. Flynn and Niven keep knocking him about this - they feel he has no real feelings, and so he is beneath contempt as a bloody butcher. They don't realize that Rathbone actually hates sending up these young boys to die. When alone or with his assistant Phipps (Donald Crisp) he shows the strain which for the sake of the company's morale he hides elsewhere. He tries to find ways to reduce the problem. One way is rigid adherence to the rules (which is another reason Flynn and Niven despise him).Then, after one of their escapades does substantial damage to the Germans, Flynn and Niven are amazed to find that Rathbone's normal threats of court-martial is dimmed by a telephone call that leaves him temporarily speechless and then laughing hysterically. Headquarters was so impressed by what Flynn and Niven did that they are promoting Rathbone to Colonel, and sending him to the headquarters staff (so he does not have to be so emotionally torn anymore). But best, he is given the power to choose his successor. He promotes Flynn to Major and commander of the aerodrome, and Niven to Captain.Flynn starts going through the tortures of the damned now. He did not expect this action, and he is not ready for sending young boys (including Morton Lowry as Niven's brother) to their death. Naturally the friendship with Niven suffers - especially after the death of Lowry. Rathbone returns a few months later - and finds Flynn is no longer so devil-may-care nor as critical (how can he be - he knows better now). Rathbone is not jubilant at the success of his revenge - he notes it quietly. This is the only Flynn - Rathbone film where Basil came out on top, and it wasn't by fighting with swords.The film shows how the war machine just mindlessly ground up a whole generation of youth in Europe. Only by being aware of the proper tricks of aerial warfare (which took months) did any pilot stand a chance of survival. But the turnover rate was due to the stupid view that massive numbers of men (even poorly trained ones) would guarantee the victory of the Allies in the skies (or on land for that matter).The film has a very realistic feel of what that dreadful situation was like. Even the use of a fictionalized Von Richtofen (Von Richter here) suggests the reality. Von Richtofen (and the German air force, for that matter) had a better training method than the allies until 1918. Until the Red Baron died the Germans did control the skies for the most part.",23,26,True

First, how the British flying aces in World War I contend with the harsh realities of war, specifically the deaths of their friends and the decisions that had to be made to send more men to their deaths (excellently portrayed by Basil Rathbone as Major Brand).  Whats most impressive, however, is how engaging the air sequences were.  They were ahead of their time and they hold up rather well today.

tt0030044,Superior clone of the 1930 version,8.0,"This is a stirring and exciting story of the courage shown by pilots who know they or their friends will likely be killed on one of their missions, and the anguish their commanders feel when sending them to their deaths. Set on the battlefields of WWI, the plot duplicates the 1930 version starring Douglass Fairbanks, Jr. In fact, whole sequences (especially flying scenes and the climactic attack) were lifted directly from the earlier film. (Note: although the 1930 version was originally entitled ""Flight Command,"" and is occasionally screened under that title by TCM, IMDb also calls it ""Dawn Patrol,"" probably to distinguish it from the 1940 Robert Taylor ""Flight Command"" about Navy pilots.) Although it's a close call, I would recommend this later film over its predecessor, for the superior performances of the lead actors. Errol Flynn (as Dick Courtney) was more involving than 1930's Richard Barthelmess, a veteran actor whose performance retains the somewhat stilted quality of the silent film era. While Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was excellent in the 1930 version as pilot Doug Scott, David Niven in the same role positively sparkles in several more light-hearted, even comedic scenes. And although Neil Hamilton played Major Brand well in the original film, at least early on in the story, the role calls for a less-sympathetic performance, and who could be less sympathetic than Basil Rathbone at his sneery best?Furthermore, current (as of 2012) releases of 1930's ""Flight Command / Dawn Patrol"" are not as visually clear in all scenes as the later version, and also have a lot of scratchy sounds and low rumble in the soundtrack, which are especially distracting in quieter scenes. Hopefully, remastered versions of both films will someday be available.Still, this is only nit-picking, as both the 1930 and 1938 versions of ""Dawn Patrol"" are excellent.

So many young pilots rose to the challenge but flew off in matchstick planes to face a deadly enemy in the sky. We share with them the revelries and tragedies met daily by this small group of flyers, most of whom didn't come back.It's wonderful to see so many superb actors in a modern day setting for a change, playing in modern wartime roles -- a nice change from the usual pirate pics and westerns we've known them for.Aviation during WW1 was a time of raw courage, luck, and a devil-may-care outlook on life. Errol Flynn, as Captain Courtney, reflects aloud in some pensive moments about the futility of waging war but it's a brutal reality and must be dealt with, which he does so bravely.David Niven, as Scotty, turns in a good supportive performance and in the end of the story learns to take on a commander's responsibilities. Actually, in real life Niven also rejoined the army in WW2 and acquired honors along the way, still retaining his popularity in movies during and after the war.""How many fine chaps will die in this war and in future wars?"" -- lines spoken by Phipps (Donald Crisp) seem to warn of the oncoming Second World War.

I particularly like the songs they sing as they belly up to the bar, most notably, ""Hurrah for the Next Man that Dies."" The dogfights in the biplanes of that era are so vivid because you can see the pilots' every move, and they can see each other -- the thumbs-up when one of them is shot to pieces and about to plummet to his death.The film captures the reality of a war that history tends to overlook more and more as time goes on.

Even with scenes lifted from the earlier film, it's a good-looking film, is very nicely shot and has a good deal of authentic atmosphere. Edmund Goulding's direction is very much assured while pacing scenes in a methodical but never overly so way. Max Steiner's score is lushly orchestrated and stirring.'The Dawn Patrol' has a gripping script, making its points without veering into heavy-handedness while the story is ceaselessly compelling, perfectly conveying the futility and passion of war, the comrades' horrors and conflicts and showing grace even under pressure.Characters are not stereotypes in any way, instead compellingly real characters with human and relatable conflicts. The sterling supporting cast has Donald Crisp in particular standing out, but the three leads are what make 'The Dawn Patrol' particularly worth watching.Rathbone has rarely been more tortured and Niven epitomises innocent grace, but it's Flynn's film in a performance that's genuinely moving (proof that he could act and had more range than given credit for when allowed).In summary, a wonderful and powerful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",11,11,False

Hughes used the same sequence in 3 pictures marketed in 1933. The stunt placed a dynamite charge in the nose of the aircraft which had a delay to ignite to be activated as the pilot left the cockpit. As the story was later published, the charge exploded just as the pilot had his foot on the seat to exit, was blown out of the plane and luckily was awake enough to open his chute.

tt0030044,An excellent film about the anguish commanders have when sending pilots into battle and how the pilots cope with their fear and anger.,7.0,"Wartime commanders have the nasty job of sending men to do battle, often resulting in their death.  In this film, flight commander Basil Rathbone gets telephone orders from the high command for the morning flights, and relays these to squadron commander Errol Flynn, who has the unenviable job of picking the men for the job. Complaining about the men's inexperience or the rickety planes does no good, since it is their duty to do as they are told, and everyone obeys.  On this particular day, Flynn has to pick two replacement pilots who have little experience, which often means their death.  It was odd to hear one pilot who was not picked remark ""Lucky devils"" as the two who were picked entered their planes, when I thought ""Poor devils.""  This show of bravado seems to be just a mask for their fear. We hear the men often singing a song with a last line ending ""Hoorah for the next man who dies.""I never fully understood the relationship enemy pilots had with one another in films set during WWI.  They often did not behave as hated enemies, but rather as part of an elite club.  There is a telling and very dramatic scene where a downed and captured German pilot, Carl Esmond, is brought into the quarters where the pilots gather to drink and sing.  He was the one who shot down David Niven, thought to be dead, and was, in turn, shot down by Flynn. Flynn's face turns grim as he walks toward the man who he thought just killed his best friend.  It looked like Flynn was going to take a poke at him, but he smiles, takes his hand and drinks a toast with him. Only Peter Willes, whose two friends were recently killed in combat, lets his true feelings surface as he lunges at Esmond and has to be forcibly restrained. He then blasts at Flynn: ""You laugh with him - joke with him - a man that just murdered your best friend. He's dead! You know that, don't you! Don't you! And so is Blaine and Madchen, my best friends. They're dead! They aren't coming home anymore! I believe you've forgotten Scotty already."" These were my sentiments exactly (and probably the writer's).  When Niven walks in very much alive and meets the man who nearly killed him, they hug and drink a toast together!As fate would have it, the realities of possible death shake up both Flynn and Niven. Flynn is made flight commander and is ordered to put every available man in the air to stave off a big push by the Germans.  And one of the new replacements is Niven's kid brother, Morton Lowry, with only nine hours of training experience. Nivens pleads with Flynn not to send him up, but there can be no exceptions and orders must be followed. To make matters worse, the feared German flying ace, Von Richter (Norman Willis), has joined the German flying force.  Lowry didn't have a chance, and his death causes a deep rift in Niven's and Flynn's friendship.  It is mended weeks later when Niven volunteers for a near suicide mission to fly alone and bomb a German armament dump 60 kilometers inside the German lines. Flynn gets Niven drunk and goes in his place, but three German planes, including one piloted by Von Richter, goes after him.",9,11,True
tt0030044,Bloody Hell!,6.0,"Fast-paced yarn of the Royal Flying Corps in 1915 France. The crates are falling apart, the death rate grows apace, but the seasoned fliers keep a stiff upper lip and all that. Flynn and Niven are two of the aviators under Squadron Commander Basil Rathbone. Everyone seems to be having a good time, except when they're being shot to pieces, except Rathbone who has been turned into a bundle of nerves by his responsibility for sending men up to die in those fragile crates.Rathbone is promoted out, and Flynn is made commanding officer. Now the burden rests with him and he gives up his profligate ways. Niven's brother arrives fresh out of flight school and Flynn, following orders, sends him on a mission from which he doesn't return. Riddled with guilt, Flynn flies a suicide mission, blows up a huge ammunition dump, and downs a couple of enemy planes before he himself is killed by von Richter, the ace. Niven is promoted to command and the whole lousy cycle begins again.(Kids: This story is about what we call ""World War One."" That's the war that came before ""World War Two."" The British were fighting against the Germans. The US entered the war late, on the side of the British. PS: We won.) The performances are okay, but the story now seems pretty dated, what with its heavy moral message in tow -- war is hell. I suppose it's an anti-war movie. The drunken recreation between missions is desperate and frantic. And in a climactic speech after Flynn's death, Donald Crisp as the adjutant spells it all out for us. The war is savage and destructive, just as the next one will be. Crisp might have done us all a greater favor if he'd explained exactly why it is that we feel compelled to get into another Big One every twenty years or so.But never mind that. Some exciting flying scenes here -- grafted on, I gather, from the earlier version of ""Dawn Patrol"", directed by Howard Hawks. Edmund Goulding's direction here is pedestrian. This territory belongs to Hawks or William Wellman or maybe Merian C. Cooper. (Perhaps the best WWI flying film is ""The Blue Max,"" which is a different story, a little confused, but captures the thrill of flying exquisitely.) The script leaves something to be desired. It now seems formulaic, though it may not have seemed so to audiences of the time. Events follow one another at a rapid and predictable tempo. No sooner is David Niven's younger brother mentioned early on, than we know he's going to show up as a novice member of the squadron. Flynn's death came as something of a surprise, though. The schematic diagram calls for his successful return to base -- wounded, and with his airplane shot to pieces, but alive.And the scenes of drunken men between missions, singing ""Hurrah For The Next Man to Die,"" fall flat. The drunkenness I can grasp, but the hilarity, no -- no matter how forced I understand it to be. Anyway, if you lose a young friend, you don't get happy if you drink. You get morose and have a crying jag. Freud was often wrong, but he was probably right when he said that grief work must be done. Paul Rosenblatt's content analysis of diaries shows that it doesn't disappear all at once, nor does it subside monotonically over time. The intensity of mourning does go down, but the decline is interrupted by irregular peaks, prompted by anniversaries, the discovery of a forgotten letter, or something. What we see here is the kind of grief work a screenwriter thinks up to help a story along.Not to bash the movie, though. It's enjoyable enough in its old-fashioned way, and the moral message, though trite, is sound enough.",1,10,True
tt0030044,"Good Remake, but not better",6.0,"In France for service in the Great War (aka World War I), handsome pilot Errol Flynn (as Dick Courtney) and pal David Niven (as Doug ""Scotty"" Scott) clash with commander Basil Rathbone (as Drake Brand) over his decisions to send young fliers out on suicide missions in rickety planes. But, with the Germans active nearby, Mr. Rathbone has limited options. Taking the lead, Mr. Flynn decides to go over Rathbone's head, completing a foolish mission with Mr. Niven co-piloting. Rathbone threatens to have him court-martialed, but a worse fate awaits Flynn – he is quickly promoted to commander of ""The Dawn Patrol"". Now in charge, Flynn must order young fliers out on suicide missions in rickety planes...This is close re-make of the Warner Bros. own ""The Dawn Patrol"" (1930), with its most exciting aerial footage simply flown in (figuratively) from the previous film. While a more crude production, the earlier film is superior. The 1930 version captures the story's sense of war dread far better. In the original, a sense of doom permeates everything, even when the characters are having a good time. Original stars Richard Barthelmess (as Courtney) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (as Scott) acted like characters trying to drown the horror of war by carousing in drink. They seemed tortured. Here, at times, Flynn and Niven look more like actors having fun with their roles.

tt0030044,"""Here's to the Next Man that Dies...""",9.0,"""The Dawn Patrol"" came out at a strange time: a few years later and it would have been a product of Warner Bros' propaganda department, matching a vicious enemy against selfless heroes. But in 1938 war was still a long way from Hollywood, so instead we get one of the last great anti-war films of the Golden Age.The cast, as usual, is superlative. Errol Flynn and David Niven are friends and drinking buddies (in real life as well as on screen) in the Royal Flying Corps, straining against the strict discipline of their commanding officer, Basil Rathbone. Rathbone gets a different sort of role: rather than the sneering villain, he portrays a sympathetic character torn apart by his duty to his superiors and his responsibility to the men he commands. In fact, the same dramatic arc afflicts Flynn and Niven in time, and the three great actors turn in some of the best performances of their careers.The flying scenes of ""Dawn Patrol"" lack the scale of ""Hell's Angels"" or ""Wings"", and a lot of scenes were lifted directly from a 1930 film of the same name, directed by Howard Hawks. The California scenery distracts a little from the verisimilitude, but the squadrons of vintage Nieuport 28's and other aircraft should make up for any shortcomings in the locations. The meat of the story takes place on the ground -- unlike in ""Hell's Angels"" -- so the action scenes in the air serve more as punctuation marks.Like previous First World War movies, ""Dawn Patrol"" portrays the cynicism and fatalism of the fighter pilots. They drink a toast to ""the next man that dies"", sing boisterous songs to bury their grief, and even welcome an enemy captive into their mess -- who cares whose side he's on, the war's over for him, so let's get drunk. There's a lot of manly horseplay and fooling around, and probably a bottle of brandy in every scene, making for a heck of a drinking game. The awful truth of the war is hammered home in scenes of youthful recruits arriving fresh from their public schools, brimming with childish bravado, ready for a great adventure -- and totally ignorant of the fate that awaits them.",8,9,False

tt0030044,Incredibly realistic and touching WWI movie,9.0,"Although I'm a classic movie aficionado and have seen more old movies than anyone I've ever met, I'd only ever seen Errol Flynn in a bit part in the Doris Day comedy It's a Great Feeling. So, for all intents and purposes, I'd never seen an Errol Flynn movie until I rented The Dawn Patrol. After only a few minutes of absorbing his performance, I was filled with awe and admiration. I haven't gone on a renting spree just yet, but I look forward to watching many more of his films in the time to come.All Quiet on the Western Front is often hailed as the greatest WWI movie ever made, but now I have a new favorite. In The Dawn Patrol, Basil Rathbone is in charge of a flying squadron and is forced to send his boys off on high risk missions. More often than not, the boys don't make it home, and there's a constant influx of new recruits whom Basil and Captain Errol Flynn have to train and prepare for the worst. This is a very unusual method of storytelling, putting the audience on pins and needles every time someone flies out, and filling them with sadness every time new characters grace the screen. There's a very natural camaraderie between the men, and most acutely between Errol Flynn and fellow soldier David Niven. They were close friends in real life, and when the camera captures their scenes, it feels like it's projecting backstage footage instead of scripted dialogue. The soldiers have more of a brotherly bond than in any other war movie I've ever seen. In singling out the leading men for their performances, I fear I'll be slighting the young boys with smaller parts; everyone in this movie gives very heart-wrenching and realistic performances. There are times when it's hard to watch, but it's an extremely well-made, well-acted film. I was very surprised at Errol Flynn's acting style. I'd expected him to overact like silent movie stars or at least ham up his scenes like a classic swashbuckler. His delivery and expressions were so realistic and modern, it's a wonder he even knew how to give such a performance, since no one else in that era did. I have a strong desire to rent The Last of Robin Hood, because I'm sure Kevin Kline will give a perfect imitation of Errol Flynn. Not only is the physical resemblance striking, but the subtlest of expressions and mannerisms are also mirrored. It was almost as if Errol Flynn were giving a Kevin Kline impression!Obviously, I highly recommend this movie, even though parts of it are very sad and remind us of the tragedies of war. It's a wonderful old movie to watch if you don't normally like old movies, because besides the color scheme, it doesn't even feel like you're watching one.",6,6,False

(I should add, however, that Jimmy Cagney, in his autobiography, agreed with those who believed Ayres was too pretty to play a convincing gangster!)This film is so much better than you'd think, and that is due not only to fine performances by Ayres and Cagney (make that, a WONDERFUL performance by Cagney, who really does ignite the screen), but also to impressive direction by Archie Mayo. I confess I usually think of Mayo as a pretty journeyman director, but maybe I've only seen his later work and ""talkies"" spoiled him. If you were to watch this film without sound, you'd be hyper-aware of the wonderful camera set-ups and editing, particularly during the prison break, when the screen is filled with jump cuts of men's legs running. Of course, without the sound, you'll miss the great period dialogue (a gangland ambush offers Ayres the opportunity to ""walk into a handful of clouds"").TCM shows this film from time to time, and you really shouldn't miss it.

When he strolls out of a pool room with his violin case under his arm he offhandedly comments ""I'm gonna teach a guy a lesson."" with a sardonic smile on his face.

Maybe not quite up there with Public Enemy and the original Scarface, but not that far behind.The acting is pretty good for an early talkie. Cagney is great as usual as the head gangster's top henchman. Lew Ayres acts well as the head guy, ""the Napoleon of crime"", although he's perhaps a little too cleancut looking for the role.The story is good, and rather dark. Mobster Louie Ricarno, after uniting all the gangs in Chicago under one organization, tries to quit crime. But things fall apart in his absence, and he's forced to return for purposes of revenge. The ending is nicely grim and while there might be enough of a ""crime doesn't pay"" moral to keep the censors happy it doesn't rub it in your face. There's some good gangster violence along the way.- a number of well-done hits, and an over- the-top scene that resembles a full-scale battle.Two other things struck me as memorable: The adulterous relationship between Cagney and his boss' wife. At one point, she takes off her wedding ring, and then they ""go somewhere"".The police captain, O'Grady, is a rather ruthless character. He blackmails Cagney into a false confession for a crime he didn't commit, by threatening to tell Ayres about his affair with Ayres's wife! Later, he lets Ayres's rivals bump him off, rather than prosecute him and risk an acquittal.

First the various mob heads resent Ayres taking over, then they resent when he leaves. Secondly, it's not made clear at all why Cagney isn't capable of running this thing by himself, he sure looks capable enough.

Funny how Cagney's smart aleck attitude and mannerisms got him stereotyped as a gangster right out of the block, and he made it seem all so natural.As for the story, Warner Brothers takes yet another stab at the menace to society theme with it's take on mob violence and competition between rival gangs. This was my first look at Lew Ayres, who heads the cast as crime boss Louie Ricarno. In an opening scene, he's out to 'teach a guy a lesson' for being a rat, and from there he sees an opportunity to bring all the local big shots together under his own umbrella. Though generally effective in the role, I did find it somewhat humorous when Ayres went into that surly pensive mood from time to time throughout the story. I also got a kick out of the scene in which Ricarno fancies himself as big a man as Napoleon, and Cagney does a mock impersonation of the dictator to the amusement of Louie's girl Doris (Dorothy Matthews).With the back drop of Louie going straight and retiring to Miami with his new wife, the film throws a minor curve with the autobiography he's writing. I thought for sure that police captain Pat Grady (Robert Elliott - O'Grady in the credits) had it right when he offered the suggestion - ""Don't write the last chapter till the night you go to the chair"". Instead, knowing that there's no safe way out of the flop house he's holed up in, Louie gussies himself up for a 'handful of cloud'. The finale is effective for Warners' purposes, the fade out hones in on the rewritten last page of the Louie Ricarno story, the 'doorway to hell' swings only one way.Keep a sharp eye and you'll catch a typo in the gangland slaughter headline of the newspaper Louie reads in the boarding house - it reads 'grewsome' for 'gruesome'.For an early talking picture, I found the film to be fairly well written and acted, most of that contribution coming from the main principals, Ayres and Cagney. I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risqué stuff for the 1930's.

Ayres' baby-faced good looks and polished exterior were supposed to clash with the reality of the gangster that he was - that is part of the whole point of the film.Ayres plays Louie Ricarno, a gangster who has decided to take the warring gangs of the city and run them like departments of a corporation of which he, of course, is president. In spite of some beefing by the other gangsters at first, in the long run this ends the in-fighting and all the gangsters make more money in the bootleg booze business and like the arrangement. Ricarno makes more money than any of them and this enables him to marry his dream-girl, retire, and live the life of a gentleman in Florida. At something like the tender age of 25 he is even writing his memoirs. However, he has two problems. First, you can take the girl out of the speak-easy (his wife) but you can't take the speak-easy out of the girl. Secondly, once Louie is retired, the same old in-fighting starts up again among the gangsters he left behind and they yearn for Louie to return and restore order. When he refuses, a couple of the gangsters cook up a plan to force him to return that goes horribly wrong and ends up killing someone close to Louie. Full of vengeance, Louie does return home, but not to restore order.Cagney here has a minor role as right hand man to Louie and one-time boyfriend of Louie's now bored wife Doris. He's perfect in the role since his openly wise-guy exterior is in sharp contrast to Ayres' gee-whiz personna, in spite of the fact that they are equally violent.Louie is a sympathetic character in many ways. He isn't someone who just picked crime as a career. Instead he grew up in poverty, lost his parents at a young age, lost two siblings to typhoid from bad milk, and just doesn't know any other way to live than dog eat dog. This doesn't excuse what he does, but it is something of an explanation. In this sense this film is ahead of its time in complexity. Also interesting is Louie's almost-friendship with Captain Pat O'Grady, the cop that is determined to get Louie and his gang off the street once and for all.",11,11,False
tt0020836,Not bad--just a bit creaky with age,7.0,"This is a very early talkie gangster film. Because it was made only a few years after talking pictures debuted, it suffers from a few defects that were related to the technology--such as an over-reliance on long shots--making the film look a bit ""stagy"". Additionally, background and incidental music in the film is noticeably absent. You really can't blame the filmmakers, as the technology was new and they still had to work out a few kinks, but it does make the film seem pretty dated and creaky. It wasn't until a year later that these two problems were pretty much eliminated in American films and even better gangster films like PUBLIC ENEMY and LITTLE CAESAR debuted.The story itself is very interesting due to its cast. Lew Ayres, who had just made a name for himself in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, stars as a ""nice"" and ""respectable"" mob leader. Only late in the film do we see him unleash a wave of extreme violence. This is actually rather ironic considering that in real life, Ayres was strongly opposed to violence and when drafted in WWII, served as a medic because he was so morally opposed to taking lives! Also, this was only the second film for Jimmy Cagney. Since he wasn't an established star, it's not surprising he plays a supporting role though he already was being cast as a mobster in films.The movie is in some ways a very typical Warner Brothers gangster film, though with one exception. Mob boss Ayres is a supposedly smart man and retires from the mob when he's still very young and able to enjoy the spoils of his work. But, when the gangs start fighting among themselves, he is reluctantly pulled back into the picture--leading to a rather dramatic conclusion. Interestingly, although the movie was pretty violent in spots and probably featured more gunfire than any film of the 30s, some of the key violent scenes are not seen but are only heard. An interesting idea no doubt spurred on by the new sound technology.",7,11,True
tt0020836,under-rated,,Fine early talkie that belongs along side Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as the gangster films that set the rules for the genre. Unlike those films however this film gives us a smart gangster who tries to get out while on top only to be  dragged back in.,8,11,False
tt0020836,"Cagney strong, but Ayres miscast and Elliott weak",6.0,"This pre-Code gangster movie is interesting primarily because of James Cagney, who is in a supporting role, that of a gangster's right-hand man. His boss is played somewhat improbably by 21- year-old Lew Ayres, who is hard to believe as he threatens rival gang members to fall in line under his authority. However, fall in line they do, that is, until Ayres decides he's had enough and decides to retire. (Yes, the pretty boy baby-face had had enough of the game, when it looks like he hasn't started shaving) When he's gone, all hell breaks loose for reasons we can't really fathom, prompting them to attempt to reel him back in by kidnapping his kid brother, who is away at a military school. Ayres is one of the casting issues; the other is the policeman played by Robert Elliott, who is far too lethargic as he delivers his lines. The script is actually pretty good, and there are some lines that are wry and just perfect for the genre and time period. The ending is drawn out, however, and it's too bad the story surrounding the love interest (played well by Dorothy Matthews) who marries Ayres but secretly loves Cagney isn't expanded on, though the scene where she coyly slips off her wedding ring to encourage him is nice. The movie hits you over the head with an anti-crime message, but as you think about the actions of the police officer, coercing statements and selectively deciding who to protect, you have to wonder how effective this message was. Anyway, the net of all of this is a reasonably entertaining movie, but nothing to write home about. This was only Cagney's 2nd movie, just before a string of movies the following year which would cement him as a star, most notably, The Public Enemy, and he's such a natural with great screen presence. As a footnote, I found it ironic that while Ayres in the movie lauds Napoleon, his brother's military training, and war in general, Ayres in real life was a conscientious objector during WWII, making him very unpopular at the time, though he served with honor in the medical corps instead.",9,10,False
tt0020836,Blueprint for the 'Big Three',9.0,"When I refer to the 'Big Three' I am of course referring to the holy trinity of early 1930's gangster flicks: Little Caesar, The Public Enemy & Scarface.Firstly, this is NOT a James Cagney movie. It's a Lew Ayres movie in which James Cagney, (In only his second movie), is amongst the great supporting cast and based on this performance it was easy to see the star in the making.Lew Ayres plays Louie Ricarno, a bootlegging gangster determined to get rich or die trying. Cagney plays Mileaway, his right hand man who's character seems to be well named as whenever any of the action takes place in the movie, Cagney seems to be a 'mile away' from it, as it's one of the few Cagney movies made where he doesn't either kill, mame or even hit anyone.After a series of tit-for-tat murders between rival gangs, Ricarno calls a meeting with all his rival bosses and proposes that in return for them declaring him ultimate boss, he will protect their operations from any rival gang who may try to encroach on their areas. One wonders whether Charles 'Lucky' Luciano ever saw this movie and used this element of it's plot as his blueprint for the 'syndicate' which he adopted after the murder of crime boss Salvatore Maranzano a year later.After a period of profitable peace for all involved, Ricarno feels that he's made enough money to quit the rackets for good and go straight. His two main reasons for this life style U turn, is his new wife Doris, (Dorothy Mathews), (who unbeknown to him is having a passionate affair with his best friend Mileaway), and his young Brother Jackie, played brilliantly by Leon Janney. Louie doesn't want Jackie to either follow in his footsteps or even rub shoulders with the ne'r-do-well's he does.It's not long after louie's departure that old gang fueds come to the fore once more and gangland killings escalate. In order to incite Louie back to the city, two gangsters plot to kidnap Jackie only to release him when Louie returns. However, the kidnapping is botched as Jackie, who blessed with intelligence of his brother, smells a rat. In his bid to escape, he is knocked over and killed by a passing truck.On hearing the news, Louie, now driven solely by vengeance on the would be kidnappers, returns to his old turf, but peace & profits are the last thing on his mind, and you half expect him to utter Al Pacino's memorable line ""Just when I thought I was out....they pull me back in""Ayres, although brilliant in his role was probably miscast, especially when you had the best movie tough guy in world playing the lead's sidekick. (A mistake they nearly duplicated with The Public Enemy until the producers woke up).One let down of the movie was the rivalry between Ayres and fellow gang boss Rocco (Noel Madison), I feel the bitterness between the two needed to be brought out in the plot a little more. Sadly, because they didn't do this, the movie is robbed of any REAL menacing villain.The Pre-code element was also very risqué and the fact that the affair between Cagney's & Mathews's chaarcters was so obviously sexual, must have had all at the Hays office pulling their hair out.Like in most early talkies, many cast members seem to struggle with adapting to the new medium, such as adopting wild animated body gestures as they would have done in silent pictures and also speaking terribly slowly as they were so often told to do. Luckily both Ayres & Cagney are on hand to show them that you didn't need to speak three words a minute to be understood on film.Doorway to Hell is a great early Warner's gangster movie and worth giving a go.Enjoy!",9,10,True
tt0020836,When Lew Ayres Was Hollywood's Golden Boy,8.0,"In 1930 Lew Ayres was Hollywood's golden boy having scored a huge success in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" for Universal, then Warners borrowed him for the baby faced gangster in ""The Doorway to Hell"". He plays Louie Ricarno, an Underworld king pin who proceeds to re-organise the rackets - not to everyone's satisfaction. While ""Little Caesar"" dealt with the rise of a mobster within an organised crime ring and ""The Public Enemy"" was about a pair of thugs making their way up in the criminal world, ""The Doorway to Hell"" tried to deal with the complexities of a gangster, even as the film starts, already called ""King of the Underworld"", who wants out but is not allowed to break away.The whole point of the film was (to me) someone struggling with their inner demons that were triumphing over his basic goodness. The role needed a clean cut actor who was believable, especially when he left the rackets to try and live a normal life and Lew Ayres was perfect, however he didn't have much of a presence in the scenes where he was doing some tough talking to his mob. It didn't help that his off-sider, Mileaway, was played by James Cagney - only his second film but he was already acting like a veteran. Even when he was almost out of the scene, a shrug of the shoulders, raised eyebrows, that ""crazy"" grin meant that audiences were watching him instead of Ayres - fortunately audiences were going to see a lot more of him in years to come.There is always a woman - this time, Doris (Dorothy Matthews), a moll, who thrives on the excitement of crime. Ricarno marries her and for her sake and for his little brother, Jackie (Leon Janney) who is away at military school, doesn't know what his big brother does and of course idolizes him - decides to give the mob away and try to write his memoirs. Doris is bored and misses Mileaway (with whom she is having a hot and heavy affair). In the meantime, without Louie's organization there is a lot of gangland violence and when two thugs, Gimpy and the Midget try to kidnap Jackie, their plan is stymied and as Jackie runs away from them he is run over and killed by a passing truck. This paves the way for Louie's return but strangely the film slows down after this. With many of the gangsters dead the police become more involved and the last 20 minutes really drag with Mileaway's confession (he only signs because he doesn't want Louie to find out about him and Doris, Louie, of course, believes he is a real pal). Louie battles with his inner demons - he may outwardly appear ""preppie"" but he idolizes Napoleon and feels War is the answer to the World's problems (obviously, in view of his real life beliefs, he didn't sound very convincing) - what a complete turnaround from his last role as the disillusioned soldier. He also has some scenes with honest cop, Captain O'Grady (Robert Elliot) who seems to be Louie's conscience.The film's pace could have been tighter and consequently the film doesn't have the same impact as ""Little Caesar"" or ""The Public Enemy"". It was interesting to see the violin cases come out and to know that it originated in this movie - now it is such a cliché. Noel Madison, who played Rocco, the only gangster, who didn't fall for Louie's tough talk, also made his debut, along with Cagney in ""Sinner's Holiday"" and was forever typecast as gangsters and thugs - a bit different to his stage career where he specialized in society types.Highly Recommended.",6,8,True

Doorway to Hell is a good late night movie to watch with a beer (if you drink) or a cup of hot cocoa along with a relaxing bowl of popcorn. The movie moves along at an okay pace, but let's face it -- it is not an action movie. It is a movie with flavor.

Hesitant at first the leaders of the crime gangs soon see the genius of Ricarno's master plan in that they now can runs their illegal business's without the fear of being rubbed out by each other.Feeling that there's nothing left for him to conquer, in the world of crime, Louie decides to retire, at the ripe old age of 22,and move to his estate in Forida to live out his life in peace and quite, with his new wife Doris, spending his time playing golf and writing his autobiography. There's also the fact that Louie's kid brother 12 year-old Jackie had been enrolled in the prestigious Fairfield Military Academy. Louie doesn't what Jackie to have anything to do with the kind of persons, gangsters, that he dealt with all his life.It turns out that without Louie in charge the organization that he founded started to fall apart. In no time at all the gangs start to go a each other in an all out gang war ending up in danger of destroying themselves. Wanting to get Louie out of retirement and thus, with him back in charge, save what's still left of the organization two of his former colleagues the Midget and his partner in crime Gimpy try to kidnap little Jackie. The two hoods plan to hold him hostage in order to get Louis back in line. The blotched kidnap attempt only has the kid, in his trying to escape, get himself run down and killed in a tragic traffic accident.With the news of Jackie's death Louie get's back to work as a crime chief and in no time at all blood is split on the streets of Chicago. Louie has his hoods gun Gimpy down and leave his body on the gutter as a warning to the now terrified Midget. That was to show the Midget just what's in store for him or anyone else who messes with either the ""Great Louie Ricarno"",the self proclaimed ""Napoleon of Crime"", or those like Little Jackie that he loves and cares about. While Louie is fixated on getting the Midget who's anything but, he stands at 5 foot ten inches and weighs about 280 pounds, his right hand man Steve Mileaway is playing around with Louie's wife Doris behind his back.Eventually having the Midget iced, off camera, Louie becomes the prime suspect in his murder.

O'Grady set Louie up in an elaborate plan, with the help of Louie's ""good friend"" Mileaway,that has him face and receive ultimate justice not from the police D.A or FBI but from his own kind the mob itself!

tt0020836,Excellent version of a much-copied script,7.0,"Based on the movies TCM showed tonight. Hollywood has filmed this story of an Al Capone-type organizing the Chicago beer racket roughly 25 times. But The Doorway to Hell appears to be the first. The benefit is that the main character is a fresh-faced Lew Ayres instead of some moon-faced, accent-faking, scene chewer like Rod Steiger (Al Capone, 1959), Robert DeNiro (the Untouchables, 1987), Paul Muni (Scarface, 1932), etc. Ayres presents a character who is naive, ambitious, likeable, lamentable, misguided, fraternal, conflicted, and a whole lot of other things. The grit is supplied by James Cagney, who is refreshingly restrained in an early role. Even the top cop is portrayed in a welcome deadpan, coming across as a guy just doing his job, rather than the selfless crime-fighter that usually infects these movies.;My minor complaint is the sped-up frame rate during the brewery shootout and the attempted kidnapping. I'm willing to write it off as a remnant of the silent era.;Overall, interesting camera work, sharp dialogue and believable performances make this early gangster film worthwhile viewing.",3,5,False

Here, at a remarkably early age, he gives a bravura performance as a smart, cocky, classy mob boss, making fools of the thugs who've sworn to rub him out. In support is Jimmy Cagney -- in only his second screen role -- as a double-crossing thug with a roving eye. Some contributors have complained that there's not a lot of gunplay in ""Doorway to Hell"" -- but that's no problem. The movie is more of a character study than a gangster film.

Nothing says 20's flappers quite like that fashion. The movie may be an antique, but for a gangster film what it crucially lacks is needed grit. I'm guessing the boyishly handsome Ayers was cast as head gangster because he's supposed to be somewhat sympathetic in a way that the formidable Cagney, for example, wouldn't. Trouble is Ayers is too soft looking to be credible on the ruthless gangster side. Instead, he found his niche as the wholesome Dr. Kildare in that popular movie series.(Can't help noticing Ayers looks facially like his contemporary John Wayne then making oaters for Lone Star. See if you agree.).Except for Cagney, the supporting cast remains obscure, maybe even for that time. Mathews, the feminine lead, hasn't much to do except cuddle covertly with Cagney. In fact, women scarcely appear at all. As a whole the movie's none too convincing, unlike Public Enemy, a year later. However, the script is pre-Code so the line between cops and robbers is none too clear, while Mathews' infidelity goes unpunished. On the other hand, the pacing lacks needed snap in the slower manner of the 20's. Anyway, it's not hard to see why this gangster epic is not grouped with the classics of the day. But it does have its moments, like that deadly underside of a big truck.",3,5,False
tt0020836,A fairly good early talkie,7.0,A fairly good early talkie gangster flick. I caught this film on TCM late last night and was thoroughly entertained by it. It only had a few faults typical of films of the early talkie period.The basic story is about a young mob boss Louie Ricarno(Lew Ayres) who through intimidation unites the gangs in the city for which he collects his percentage and piece reins in the city under his stewardship. He then gets married to Doris(Dorothy Mathews) and retires to Florida to write and play golf he leaves the syndicate in the hands of his right hand man Steve Mileaway(James Cagney) but soon the gangs are again warring and Louie for family reasons must return to the city and deal with the situation.The film is well directed and the acting particularly Cagney's is a forerunner of his future career as a film tough. I think Ayres did a decent job in the lead role remember he was only 22 when he made this film but he is able to make Louie feel like he is the boss of the city. There is also a great gang fight scene at a local brewery this is one part where Archie Mayo gets a little lazy and only shoots the great action from one camera location at long distance.

tt9526392,Great performance by Toni Servillo,8.0,"QUI RIDO IO (2021), a film by Italian director Mario Martone, can be summed up in two words: Toni Servillo. The actor's genius allows him to incorporate the different facets, not always pleasant, often contradictory and even immoral, of Eduardo Scarpetta (1853-1925), actor and director who marked Neapolitan comedy at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, to a great extent. Partly due to the comic character he created, Felice Sciosciammocca. Actually, the first scene of the film is a long sequence that culminates with the appearance of this character on stage, which leads the audience to great euphoria.However, as we progress in the story, we realize that this biographical film intends to direct our attention to a very concrete episode in Scarpetta's life. By parodying the tragedy ""La Figlia di lorio"", by Gabriele D'Annunzio, one of the most important Italian poets of the time, Scarpetta is accused of plagiarism, finding himself involved in a complex legal process, which puts in risk the conquered success.The scenes in court are a delight for the spectator, with emphasis on Scarpetta's intelligent argumentation, raising very current issues, related to the notions of plagiarism, adaptation, freedom of expression. In the case of the ""King of Laughter"", it is not surprising that the film culminates in a comic performance by Eduardo Scarpetta, who transforms the courtroom into a theater stage.",5,5,False
tt0022286,A Thug's Life,8.0,"THE PUBLIC ENEMY (Warner Brothers, 1931), directed by William A. Wellman, is a prime example of how a motion picture produced in the early sound era can still hold up today. A worthy follow-up to the studio's most recent gangster outing, LITTLE CAESAR (1930), that elevated Edward G. Robinson to stardom, THE PUBLIC ENEMY brought forth another new screen personality, James Cagney, displaying a different kind of movie thug: rough, with guys who betray him; tough, with women who get on his nerves or play him for a sucker; and ready, to succeed by socking, punching, slapping or killing anybody who gets in his way. His only soft spot for his mother, but far from being a ""Momma's Boy."" Through its passage in time element starting in 1909 Chicago, THE PUBLIC ENEMY plays in the biographical mode, displaying the origins of its main characters, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle, as boys (Junior Coughlan and Frankie Darro), leading to their adult lives (James Cagney and Edward Woods) as tough thugs. Tom Powers character, regardless of his fine upbringing, indicates he was born ... to be bad. He has a brother, Mike (Donald Cook) who knows of his activities, while their mother (Beryl Mercer) may suspect but overlooks his actions. As things start going well for Tom and Matt in the bootlegging racket under Paddy Ryan's (Robert Emmett O'Connor) leadership, Scheiner Burns, a rival gang leader, attempts on taking over Ryan's establishment, leading to more gun-play, especially for Tom, quick on the trigger, only to have things backfire on him.If not the most famous of the early gangster films, THE PUBLIC ENEMY is one of the most revived. Quite frank in its actions, and adult for its intentions, much of the then so- called violence occurs out of camera range. Yet, whatever is displayed on film is something not to forget. These days, there isn't a year that goes where THE PUBLIC ENEMY isn't televised. Whenever a topic pertaining to THE PUBLIC ENEMY arises, it's not the story that immediately comes to mind, but Cagney's individual scenes consisting of squirting beer from his mouth into the bartender's face; Tom's cold-blooded killing of Putty Nose (the man who let him take the rap for a crime) while playing his last song on the piano; and Tom's off-screen shootout with a rival gang in a fancy nightclub, stumbling out in the pouring rain saying to himself, ""I ain't so tough."" All these scenes pale in comparison until reaching its most chilling climax ever recorded on film. Yet, the one where Tom, at the breakfast table, pushes a grapefruit into his mistress Kitty's (Mae Clarke) face, never has such a brief scene have such an long impact. Other than Clarke's famous few minutes of grapefruit glory, Mia Marvin (whose face resembling Maureen ""Marcia Brady"" McCormick from TV's 1970s sit-com, ""The Brady Bunch"") playing a slut named Jane, is one who gets her face slapped after getting Tom drunk enough to seduce him. The second billed Jean Harlow doesn't get any abuse from her leading man as did the other two actresses receiving no screen credit for their trouble. While Harlow's performance has been criticized as one of her worst, chances are her portrayal might have been intended to be enacted in that manner. Harlow's Gwen Allen is an uneducated blonde floozy with her gift for attracting men. What possibly hurts the film is not Harlow herself, but the inane dialog she recites, (""Oh Tommy, I can love you to death!"". Joan Blondell's limitations on screen is mostly one involving her relation with Tom's pal, Matt. Edward Woods, whose has almost equal screen time with Cagney, is a Hollywood name very few recollect today. Several documentaries profiling gangster films have indicated Woods as the initial star of THE PUBLIC ENEMY with Cagney assuming the subordinate role, with director Wellman seeing an error with the casting and wisely having these actors switch roles. While a smart move on Wellman's part, he failed to switch roles on the boy actors who portrayed them, especially a keen observer noticing Frankie Darro playing Matt, not Junior Coughlan playing Tom, performing in the Cagney manner. Donald Cook, Beryl Mercer and Robert O'Connor appearing in subordinate roles, are essential with their parts, but never outshine Hollywood's finest movie thug, a/k/a Public Enemy, James Cagney, whose tougher roles, ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES (1938) and WHITE HEAT (1949) were years into his future. With limited underscoring, the theme song, ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles,"" like Cagney and his grapefruit, has long become associated with THE PUBLIC ENEMY.THE PUBLIC ENEMY, which has become one of the first major movies from the Warner Brothers library to be distributed on video cassette (consisting mostly of prints from slightly edited reissues), and later on DVD (with either edited or restored prints), can be seen quite frequently on Turner Classic Movies. It might not have the realistic violence as any crime film of today, but THE PUBLIC ENEMY presents itself as a gangster drama that doesn't have to be all blood and guts to become successful.

tt0022286,Great film from the beginnings of the gangster-movie-genre,8.0,"""The Public Enemy"" is one of the starting points of the great season of gangster movies, a very interesting work. It is not the story of the rise and fall of some big boss of crime. Tom Powers (James Cagney) and Matt Doyle (Edward Woods) are just small time crooks, and so they remain throughout the movie. Only, they make the big money that the circumstances of prohibition offer to any criminal. Tom is just a semi-illiterate, naturally violent thug. He is not even professional. He kills just out of stupidity or desire of a pointless revenge, that ultimately will severely damage himself. Further evidence of his cheap personality is shown when he instantly falls for the vulgar, tasteless girl Gwen (Jean Harlow). By the way, Harlow looks remarkably unattractive (to our modern eyes, at least). Was it a choice of director Wellmann? Matt is slightly better than Tom, but clearly he has not the guts to cross his mate. In my opinion a major credit of the film is that it systematically avoids cliché. Neither Tom nor Matt are outcomes of poverty and social injustice. They come from simple but honest, decent and loving families. But they are both bad (that's the word) and they use the freedom and opportunities of their democratic country to make evil.In ""The Public Enemy"" we find probably the first instances of the beautiful stylish cinematography and clever camera-work that will become the trade-mark of later gangster and noir movies. Some scenes are unforgettable, like the final one, or that under the rain, or that of Cagney abusing the girl. The brief scene of the killing of the horse is pure cinematic genius.In the film there are also some naiveness and clumsiness, though. The way Tom undergoes the personality of his good brother is far-fetched. It is not clear why a gangster in a hospital, wounded in a gun-fight, is not under strict police control. The behavior of Tom's boss in the ending is illogical. Moreover, the part where Tom and Matt are kids is too long (we audience are all eager to see Cagney!), and action is a bit scarce for a gangster movie. ""The Public Enemy"" was Cagney's breakout film, and really he makes a powerful and accurate job. Actually, a strong acting is provided by the whole cast. The director William A. Wellmann handles the movie with sound talent.""The Public Enemy"" is a beautiful and historically important movie. I recommend it to any cinema-lover",50,60,False

Though films about crime had been done in the silent era, sound was what really ushered in this particular genre. I've always maintained that musicals and gangster films are the only two movie genres that date from the sound era.Of course this film about a young man's rise to prominence in the bootleg liquor business during Prohibition made James Cagney a star. Interestingly enough Edward Woods was originally supposed to be Tom Powers and Cagney was cast as best friend Matt Doyle. After some footage had been shot, Director William Wellman scrapped it and had Cagney and Woods exchange roles. Stars get born in many and strange ways.Some critics have complained about Beryl Mercer's part as Cagney's mother, saying she's overacts the ditziness. I disagree with that completely. In the prologue section with Cagney and Woods as juveniles, there is a two parent household. The boys have a stern Irish father and a mom who'd spoil them if she could. The older kid who is later played by Donald Cook has more the benefit of the two family home and both influences. That and the fact that World War I leaves him partially disabled prevents him from thinking about the gangster trade. Cagney misses the war and is spoiled by mom. I knew a woman like Beryl, in her own world with a stream of nonsensical chatter to keep out the reality of things. Her portrayal for me rings true.Oddly enough in The Roaring Twenties Cagney is a veteran who enters the rackets because he can't get a legitimate job and its easy money.Both The Public Enemy and Little Caesar are short films, edited down to the essentials so the viewer ain't bored for a minute.

There is only one scene I could think of that was an event in O'Banion's life. The scene with the horse. You'll see what I mean when you see the movie. This movie doesn't go into as much detail with real events as Scarface, but it doesn't matter because everything is perfect. The movie also unintentionally glorifies gangsters again. These characters become guys you like. Especially Cagney's character Tom Powers. I guess that's why there is that introduction at the beginning and even in the end so you don't end up liking them.

My favorite part is probably the part where he goes inside a building to take on the Burke mob with two guns. When he gets out you hear screams from inside and Cagney, who is wounded, utters the famous lines, ""I ain't so tough."" This movie is just perfect. Another scene I never forget is the final scene.

From their teen-aged years into young adulthood, unredeemable Tom and obstinate Matt have an increasingly lucrative life , bootlegging during the Prohibition era. Tom's bad way of life is constantly set up against his brother Mike's (Donald Cook) . Meanwhile Tom falls in love with a gorgeous girl named Gwen Allen (Jean Harlow , though Louise Brooks was offered this role in this film) .

Even as a gangster's accidental death threatens to spark a bloody mob war .Classic gangster movie contains top-notch performances , unpretentious familiar drama, thrills , fast-paced , action , and a shocking final . Magnificent James Cagney in the title role as a snarling and ominous gangster . Edward Woods was originally hired for the lead role of Tom Powers and James Cagney was hired to play Matt Doyle, his friend . However, once director William A. Wellman got to know both of them and saw Cagney in rehearsals, he realized that Cagney would be far more effective in the star role than Woods, so he switched them . Very good support cast formed by known actresses who subsequently would have an important career as Jean Harlow , Joan Blondell and Mae Clarke including her infamous grapefruit scene that caused women's groups around America to protest the on-screen abuse of Mae Clarke . As several versions exist of the origin of the notorious grapefruit scene, but the most plausible is the one on which James Cagney and Mae Clarke agree: the scene , they explained, was actually staged as a practical joke at the expense of the film crew, just to see their stunned reactions ; there was never any intention of ever using the shot in the completed film , filmmaker Wellman, however, eventually decided to keep the shot, and use it in the film's final release print . Atmospheric and appropriate musical score , Scorsese says that Wellman's use of music in the film influenced his own first gangster picture, Mean Streets (1973) .Wellman was an expert in all kind of genres as Gangster, drama , Film Noir , Western and adept at comedy as he was at macho material , helming the original ¨ A star is born ¨(1937) (for which he won his only Oscar, for best original story) and the biting satire ¨Nothing sacred¨ (1937) , both of which starred Fredric March for producer David O. Selznick . Both movies were dissections of the fame game, as was his satire ¨Roxie Hart¨ (1942), which reportedly was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films.

James Cagney, who made a career out of playing tough guys, appeared as Tom Powers, a young man who loved the company of all the Irish wise guys in his area. The film starts with a message from the studio about one is going to witness as it wanted to point to a social problem, and it ends with a sort of disclaimer about what was seen a social issue at the core of the society of those years.Tom Powers rises to the top of the crime scene when Prohibition went into effect. There was a lot of money to be made smuggling liquor and having pals like Paddy Ryan, who controlled the trade. Helped by his inseparable Matt Doyle, they make their mark as people that could get away with what the crimes they were committing. Tom Powers inspired violence because he was ruthless in the way he wanted to do things.The film, made before the arrival of the infamous Hays Code, gets away with showing the morality of the gangster on the scene and the women they went after.

tt0022286,A brilliant study of Mob Rule in the 1920's,8.0,"The Public Enemy is more than just a story about the rise and fall of a crimean lord in the 1920's. Hell, it even says that at the beginning and end of the picture. It states, ""The Public Enemy is not a man, nor is it a character, it is problem that we, The Public, must solve."" James Cagney gives a magnificent performance as Tom Powers, a man who started off as a petty thief with sidekick Matt Doyle (played excellently by Edward Woods) and rose to become a powerful beer smuggler during the era of Prohibition and Gang Rule. Yet this film is not all about Tom Powers and his rise to power; it is about the vast feeling of change that America was experiencing during the Roaring Twenties. America was attempting to adjust to the aftermath of World War I (which is explored brilliantly in this film in a sequence through which Tom's brother, Mike, refuses to drink from a keg of beer smuggled in by Tom for his dinner party) People like Mike were still trying to feel that sense of loyalty towards the government after World War I. Yet that loyalty somehow vanished with the development of Prohibition and the rise of gang rule in urban society. Director William A. Wellman explores deeply with this subject matter as we analyze Tom's family and how they have adjusted to the effects of change upon American society. In Tom's case, he yearns for power which became a craving for all Americans during the 1920's. Matt also is one of those who yearns for power. Mike, on the other hand, wants to remain conservative about American values. He wants to keep things the way they are with his family. He does not crave for power as much as his brother Tom which allows him to survive at the end of the picture. As a result, we, the American Public, learn at the end of the picture that power is bigger than any one man and that it will smite any man who tries to take full control of it. Tom attempts to do that and ends up losing everything dearest to him. He loses his friends, his girls, but most of all, he loses his soul.

tt0022286,One of the greatest films of its time,9.0,"This is the film that made Jimmy Cagney a star and, along with LITTLE CAESAR and SCARFACE (with Paul Muni, not the modern ultra-violent version), made the gangster genre king at Warner Brothers in the 1930s. And, while there were so many more similar films after it, very, very few came close to it in style, impact and story. In fact, it's Cagney's best gangster film other than WHITE HEAT (his tour-de-force and Film Noir classic from 1949).A lot of the reason it's such a great film is that since it was a new-style film, it doesn't seem clichéd or derivative. Plus, it takes a strong and unflinching tone that NEVER would have been possible under the stricter guidelines of the Hays Office only a few short years later. Instead of just telling you that Cagney is a heartless jerk or showing him do some ""sanitized"" violence, he is a cruel man who is vile enough to slam a half a grapefruit in his girlfriend's face--just because he's bored with their relationship. And, he becomes a top gangster by being an enforcer--slugging, stealing and killing his way through organized crime. And, in the very end, the film ends with the best final scene in gangster history (except, once again for WHITE HEAT and its amazing finale).You can see why this film made Cagney a star--a great film in every way.",13,19,True
tt0022286,One of the Great Early Gangster Films,8.0,"A young hoodlum (James Cagney) rises up through the ranks of the Chicago underworld, even as a gangster's accidental death threatens to spark a bloody mob war.The script is loosely adapted from ""Beer and Blood"", an unpublished book from John Bright and Kubec Glasmon on the life of Dean O'Banion, Al Capone's biggest rival. We see a variety of references to Irish mobsters, including Samuel ""Nails"" Morton, who was famously killed by a horse. Just like the real-life mobster, Samuel ""Nails"" Nathan of the film is avenged when the horse is shot.This is, of course, Cagney's breakout role. And what better role for him? Prior to ""Public Enemy"", he had been a hoofer on the New York stage. This experience really solidified him as a notable actor, as he had control over his movements that others might not have. Interestingly, he was originally cast as the good guy -- the last minute switch probably saved this movie as well as marked the decision that would catapult Cagney to stardom. (Some scenes were even filmed with Cagney in the other role before director William Wellman realized his mistake.)As for how the dance background helped his acting, critic Lincoln Kirstein noted Cagney ""has an inspired sense of timing, an arrogant style, a pride in the control of his body and a conviction and lack of self-consciousness that is unique. No one expresses more clearly in terms of pictorial action the delights of violence, the overtones of a subconscious sadism, the tendency towards destruction, toward anarchy, which is the base of American sex appeal."" Beautifully said.Playwright Robert Sherwood expressed how Cagney's character was the ideal anti-hero. He wrote that Cagney ""does not hesitate to represent Tom as a complete rat -- with a rat's sense of honor, a rat's capacity for human love; and when cornered, a rat's fighting courage. And what is more, although his role is consistently unsympathetic, Mr. Cagney manages to earn for Tom Powers the audience's affection and esteem."" In its own time, the film was thought of as a bit too violent, and there are a few moments that might still be considered shocking today. However, with the changing norms between the 1930s and today, what really stands out is the misogyny that barely earned a mention upon release. The most memorable scene, of course, is Cagney smashing a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face. But his abusive language to her, suggesting his desire to drown Clarke, is hard to take and still remain empathetic with the gangster.There are very few films that can be said to be really inspirational to the gangster film. This one, Howard Hawks' ""Scarface"" (1932) and ""Little Caesar"" (1931) are at the top of that short list. If it is not evident enough from watching the film itself, the special feature interview of Martin Scorsese should cement the deal. Author TJ English feels this is ""perhaps the most influential gangster flick in the history of American movies"", but that may be overstating it a little.Some credit must be given for ""Public Enemy"" succeeding and remaining a top film, however. As strange as it sounds, there were at least 25 gangster movies in 1931 and at least 40 in 1932. So being among the one or two remembered almost a century later is actually quite a feat. Even William Wellman, who directed a staggering nine gangster films between 1928 and 1933 is really only remembered for this one.",15,17,False

Instead, it's treated as a classic, but in my book, that's because of Cagney and little else. Okay, I almost forgot the movie's centerpiece: the grapefruit-in-the-face episode that shocked audiences of the time, but now seems little more than an odd way to force feed a friend. Still, there's the celebrated Harlow, but it's before her big roles. She does have one big lounging scene in silky white get-up that's eye-catching.

Too bad we don't see more of her since she's the real female counterpart to Cagney. Surprisingly for a pre-Code production, almost all the gun violence occurs off-screen, while, on the other hand, the sexual innuendos are made unmistakably clear. Still, the ending leaves me puzzled. I expected Cagney's final retribution to be shown as an object lesson to audiences. Instead, we get a trussed-up, unrecognizable corpse. It's a dramatic scene, but hardly instructive in a movie whose prologue intends it to be instructive.

tt0022286,"""The meanest boy in town""",8.0,"In the early days of the talkies, a somewhat panicky film industry drafted in players from the theatre in the hopes that they would be the best suited to the new medium. If anything though these stagey hams only added to the awkwardness of those early sound movies. However a couple of years on a new kind of star began to emerge, those with unique voices, full of character, not necessarily realistic but injecting some smart-sounding talk into cinema after the silents.James Cagney wasn't originally supposed to be the lead in The Public Enemy. He was cast as the sidekick, but director William Wellman soon realised he was the better man for the top job. And it's not surprising that he stood out, despite a lack of experience. It's not deep acting ability (although he would demonstrate that later in his career), it's presence; a raw, captivating charisma. He brings a compelling life to the part of Tom Powers, much as Edward G. Robinson did in Little Caesar six months or so earlier. But whereas Robinson was more of an Al Capone figure, Cagney is more the lean, young street brawler than the cigar-chomping kingpin. The gangster genre had found the perfect actor for another of its archetypes.Scripted by Kubec Glasmon, John Bright and Harvey Thew, The Public Enemy is at the forefront of the then-popular mob movies, mainly thanks its brutal presentation of gangland. There were plenty of movies in which hoods gunned each other down with far more abandon, but in The Public Enemy the violence is more shocking through its context. The picture begins by showing the protagonists as kids. This was ostensibly to demonstrate the origins of criminality, but by giving us that glimpse of childhood, the later fates of the characters seem all the more grim and tragic. Cagney's doting mother remains a presence throughout the movie to keep this angle going.William Wellman was ideal for such a project, since it's violence that brings out his inventive side. A little bit of action goes a long way in a Wellman movie. When Donald Cook punches Cagney, Cagney falls and crushes a chair. At other times the director has a bit of nasty business take place off screen, something which only the new sound technology would fully allow, cunningly drawing attention to the wider context. Involving the audience is another trick. For key moments he'll change the angle so that Cagney is almost staring into the lens, bearing down upon us.And with those piercing eyes, commanding tone and short, sharp movements, Cagney is ideal for such an aggressive visual style. And yet these very strengths would present him with one drawback. As stars began to emerge that seemed so intrinsic to the tones and tropes of one genre, typecasting set in hard. The Public Enemy is an awesome debut for Cagney, but it also formed a constricting mould this intelligent and versatile actor would struggle to break.",11,12,False
tt0022286,An Original Ethnic Mobster.,8.0,"Compared to Mervyn LeRoy's ""Little Caesar"", ""The Public Enemy"" is a little more -- well, I don't want to use the word ""sophisticated"" because it's anything but that. It's more -- developmental. Yes, that's the word. Little Caesar's character begins and ends as an adult gangster. Tom Powers (Jimmy Cagney) is first introduced as a young boy, hanging around with his pal Matt Doyle (Edward Woods), being whupped for stealing by his policeman father. The stern old man uses a razor strap. Maybe today it looks like child abuse to some people but it was probably common enough at the time. My mother used to break Kochloevels over my back. In any case, such punishment did neither Tom Powers nor myself any good since we both turned out wicked.Tom and Matt grow up into young men who are hoodlums in the employ of Puttynose, who teaches them the tricks of the trade, an Irish Fagin, but he breaks his promise and skips out on them when they need his help. Years later, an unforgiving Tom wreaks his revenge on the pathetic Puttynose. Then Tom and Matt are taken under the wing of Paddy Ryan, and finally Samuel ""Nails"" Nathan, both of whom treat our protagonists well. In fact, I rather liked Nails. He's cheerful, generous, and loyal. I mean, considering that he's a gangster, a thief, and a murderer. When Nails is thrown from his horse and killed, Tom and Matt sensibly shoot the horse. There's a sub-plot involving some dames the two guys pick up in a speakeasy. Matt marries his moll but Tom gets tired of his (Mae Clarke) and puts finito to their affair by shoving a grapefruit in her face. Mr. Nice Guy. Tom then meets Jean Harlow and she seems to fall for him, although his interest in her is rather more glandular than anything else. She doesn't make herself available in the sense that his other girl friends have and Tom is tearing his hair out, uttering hoarse, goaty cries: ""A guy could go screwy from this."" Her part is kind of small and Tom never does get it on with her. When a rival gang kills his friend Matt, Tom picks up two pistols, barges into the gang's hangout, and shoots it out with them, severely wounded in the process. He's visited in the hospital by his Ma, his moralistic brother, and his sister-in-law, and he asks them to forgive him. Doesn't do him any good. The rival gang kidnaps him from the hospital and delivers him to his home, full of new lead.Like ""Little Caesar,"" this film gives us many scenes and characters that were to become icons. On their first big job, a friend of Tom's and Matt's, Loopy Louie, is shot by the cops and we see the wake in Louie's parlor, with a matronly immigrant mother moaning, ""He was always a good boy."" To a parking valet, Tom snaps, ""Hey, watch it. Dat car's got gears. It ain't no Ford."" As for the performances, Edward Wood was famously intended to play the lead before the roles were switched, with Cagney taking the role of Tom. It was a good decision. Matt is likable but a little wooden, whereas Cagney sizzles on screen. Jean Harlow's every line is laugh worthy. Like Cagney, she was from New York but her accent here stops just short of a parody of British. ""I cahn't."" And, ""Me neyether."" Also, she looks, well, BIG in this movie, maybe because she's paired with Cagney, but it's not just that she's as tall as he is but that she's zoftig too, a bit more broad of beam than has been noticeable in her other films.The censors were beginning to impose their will on the film industry, so every shooting takes place off screen and there is virtually no blood. I guess the code was not yet firm enough in place to prevent the presentation of a tailor as a homosexual. When Cagney is being fitted for his first suit, he tugs at his waist and tells the guy to leave plenty of room in their. ""Here's where you need extra room,"" says the tailor, squeezing Cagney's upper arm, ""Just feel that muscle."" Cagney minces away from the encounter. Not that there's any suggestion of homosexual bonds between Tom Powers and Matt Doyle. They're just friends who grew up together.You must see this movie if you haven't already. It was one of three that set the genre firmly on its feet in the early 1930s, the others being ""Little Caesar"" and ""Scarface."" Look at it this way. Without these films, we might never have had ""The Godfather.""",10,12,True
tt0022286,"""Remember this boys, you gotta have friends.""",9.0,"This movie offers the quintessential Cagney, by the lamp post in the rain, a tense close up that signals the arrival of a star. It was only his third film, but what an impact he had. The movie would be great even if it came out today.Of course, James Cagney would have plenty of time to polish up his gangster image, his turn as Rocky Sullivan in ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" is one of my all time favorite characterizations. ""The Public Enemy"" allows both Cagney and Warner Brothers to sharpen up their story telling skills, but even for 1931, this is a powerful tale. Unlike 'Angels', boyhood friends Tom Powers and Matt Doyle both take up a life of crime as an answer to the easy way up and out of poverty. Told in crisply dated vignettes, the film progresses through the Depression and World War I as it offers Tom (Cagney) and brother Mike (Donald Cook) taking separate paths under the watchful eye of Ma Powers (Beryl Mercer).The movie has more than it's share of defining scenes, most viewers will identify with the Mae Clarke grapefruit smackeroo, but there are a lot more. The black cat crossing Putty Nose's (Murray Kinnell) path as the boys renew their acquaintance is just the best harbinger of bad luck, culminating in the off screen gunshot that screams revenge. It was Putty who taught the gangster trainees about honor and loyalty, but in reverse. Also, how about the quick exchange of a thousand dollars to bring a race horse to justice for accidentally killing mob benefactor Nails Nathan (Leslie Fenton). The coal chute cover for the rapid staccato of machine gun bullets was another inspired piece of work, culminating in the very real artistry of a skilled shooter taking it out on a cement wall.Following Tom's confrontation with the Schemer Burns gang, again off camera for the viewer to fill in the blanks, director William Wellman wryly uses Ma Powers to signal his final return home. With strange premonition, she utters - ""You're comin' home, aintcha Tommy, to stay?"" His arrival is one of the all time shocker finales of film history, a perfect dichotomy between the visual and the sound accompaniment to the strains of ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"". What an ending! Warner Brothers begins and ends this tale with a warning and an exhortation, signaling the public enemy as not a single man or character but a problem that the public must solve. Seventy five years later they could still be putting the same captions into their films, as each generation finds a way to deal with it's own brand of criminal enterprise. But here in the early days of sound cinema, James Cagney set a high mark that was rarely ever challenged for gangster supremacy on screen.",9,12,True
tt0022286,What do Al Jolson and Wild Bill Wellman have in common?....,8.0,"... They both saw something in James Cagney. Jolson saw Cagney in a stage production he liked so much that he bought the rights. He would only sell the film rights to Warner Brothers if Cagney (and Joan Blondell) reprised their roles. The result was the film ""Sinners' Holiday"", and Cagney and Blondell stole the picture out from under the actual leads. Yet Cagney remained in supporting roles afterwards. . Bill Wellman was the director of 1931's ""Public Enemy"" about two boyhood friends who become Prohibition era hoods. Originally, Edward Woods was supposed to play the more volatile of the two, but Wellman quickly figured out that relatively unknown James Cagney was the versatile dynamo he needed for the lead, and the roles were reversed. To do otherwise would be to imagine Little Caesar with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. As the gangster with a fast rise and a hard fall instead of Edward G. Robinson.There was no production code at the time, but even for 1931, this film is jarringly violent. Tom Powers (Cagney) is shown growing up in Chicago with a brutal father, a moralizing older brother, and an enabling doormat of a mother. Not finding any role models at home, Powers and his childhood friend Matt find them - and easy money - by befriending the neighborhood gangsters. They also find early betrayal - a score they settle later. When Prohibition becomes law, the real money and the real violence begin. Meanwhile, Tom's brother has returned from war a broken man, just reinforcing Tom's view that his brother is a chump. The violence escalates to the shocking conclusion. And all I can say is that you'll never listen to the song ""Forever Blowing Bubbles"" quite the same again.One leg of the plot that just seems rather wedged in, but is interesting and even amusing today is Jean Harlow as Tom's love interest. This is before she went to MGM for the remainder of her career and short life. She just doesn't have her trademark screen persona down yet and strangely enough she is supposed to be a ....Texan???? She sounds like somebody from Brooklyn who was being voice coached to sound like the Queen of England, but she can't quite make the jump.This film would probably be just a 5 or 6 out of 10 without Cagney - an interesting and adequate precode. Seeing Cagney explode on the screen for the first time in the lead makes it jump to an 8/10.",10,10,False

tt0022286,"Hogarth's ""Good Apprentice and Bad Apprentice"" brought up - to - date...in a manner of speaking.",10.0,"SCARFACE was a study of a truly monstrous, violent malefactor - a kingpin of crime. LITTLE CAESAR too deals with the rise of a criminal to being the head of the criminal organization (or a leading figure in it) before he too falls. It has been nicely compared to a modern version of Andrew Carnegie's philosophy of self-help, improvement, and modernizing your business organization. But THE PUBLIC ENEMY was a type of modern version of the William Hogarth series of prints about the Good and Bad apprentices. The prints (I think there were ten) showed two boys who are raised side by side in a poor area of London. But one is hard working and industrious, and the other is lazy and opportunistic, and vicious. The hard working one slowly rises in the world as he prospers, and the bad one slowly becomes a criminal. In the long run the good one becomes the Lord Mayor of London, and the bad one ends up on the gallows for murder. Tom Powers (Jimmy Cagney) is the ""bad apprentice"" and his brother Mike (Donald Cook) the ""good apprentice"" but the story is more twisted than Hogarth's straightforward story suggests. The two brothers are the sons of a strict father (a policeman) and an overly sentimental mother: Beryl Mercer. Mercer is not one of my favorite actresses (all her major roles are incredibly teary women, usually mothers - her acting must have been acceptable in the 1930s, but is hardly worthwhile in the 2000s). However, here her performance actually fits. She favors Tom! She is obviously a weak type - her husband was the dominant figure in the family. Once he left, she could not bring herself to punish Tom - as he deserved to be. Instead she let him run wild. She also barely appreciates Mike's sacrifices (he goes to fight in World War I, and gets gassed, and while Tom's material wealth increases due to crime, Mike is only able to get a job as a streetcar conductor). At the conclusion of the film, one wonders what the death of Tom is going to do to her. Probably it will kill her.Tom and his friend Matt Doyle (Edward Woods) graduate from petty thefts for the gang run by ""Putty Nose"" (Murray Kinnell). He leaves them in a lurch, and yet they continue their criminal rise as pals. We see them bullying a speakeasy owner in using their brand of beer (Tom really enjoying enjoying it, by the way). Later we see their use as killers for gangsters. Eventually they even the score with ""Putty Nose"", who pleads for his life when they catch with him. By that time they are working for Nails Nathan, getting nicer apartments, better clothing, and money to buy gifts for Mom (and to show up brother Mike). Tom and Matt move from common whores to molls (Tom's is Mae Clarke - who gets the grapefruit treatment in the film's best recalled sequence). Then Tom meets a classier dame: the slumming socialite Gwen Allen (Jean Harlow). The scenes between Cagney and Harlow are too few to really judge any screen chemistry by. Harlow's character is a measuring stick, showing the highpoint of Tom's rise in the world through crime. Sadly, after this film, they never were re-teamed again. Her future partners were Gable, Beery, Tone, and others on the MGM lot, not the Warner's lot.The death of Nathan leads to the slow disintegration of the gang, beginning with the death of Matt in a street assassination that Tom escapes. But at the end of the line for Tom is in avenging his friend: he obviously has killed or seriously wounded many in the shootout, but he gets badly wounded himself. And in the end he does get kidnapped from the hospital, and is dumped, dead, on his doorstep. Mike discovers his corpse. I don't envy him - he'll have to tell what happened to his mother who is busy preparing Tommy's room up stairs.",6,9,True

While he was well-known for his gangster roles, this character isn't a saint by any stretch, but he's far from vicious or deadly like ""Little Caesar"". In addition, this early film is the only film that ever paired him with Jimmy Cagney. Cagney, at this point, was the lesser star and has a rather small role in the film as Robinson's right-hand man. The breakout film, THE PUBLIC ENEMY, was released just before SMART MONEY and at the point of making this second film, the studio didn't know that he was now a mega-star.Robinson is a barber with an uncanny ability to gamble and win. Eventually, he and his friends pool their money and send him to ""the big city"" and even though he at first is bankrupted, he eventually becomes the biggest and most famous gambler around the country. The only problems are that he's a lousy judge of women AND the District Attorney is out to get him no matter what it takes! The film is pretty well written and interesting--not the usual gangster stuff. Plus, there are a few neat scenes that took place since the film was created before the strict Production Code was created--so you get to see Eddie kick a woman in the rear as well as have another lady try to offer him sex to pay off her debt to him! Pretty risqué here and there, but in general this isn't really that violent or salacious a film. Just a good drama with some nice twists and decent acting.PS--When you watch the film, look for a brief cameo by Boris Karloff.

Well, maybe a little more Cagney, as he is just a supporting player here, but overall I had no complaints watching this 1931 film.Robinson was great in the lead as ""Nick the Barber,"" (full name ""Nick Venizelos."") Cagney is ""Jack,"" an old friend who is employed by Nick. The Greek is a barber, but he's really a full-time gambler or evolves into that role quickly during this story. He goes from small-town hick to big city boss but the road is bumpy along the way. He gets taken by the big crook in town twice, gets hustled by a couple of blondes (Nick's real weakness) but overcomes all of them to be gambling czar.After Nick's successful jaunts at revenge are completed, the last third of the film is devoted to the city's district attorney trying to get some goods on Nick and put him away and get him out of his city.This movie, as expected considering the year it was made, is very dated but another of those early '30s films that has a lot of snap, crackle and pop to it. The dialog is crisp and edgy with the expressions of the day and everybody is just nasty enough to make them all interesting characters.Robinson, as in ""Little Caesar,"" is super in here, much like the cocky gangster roles Cagney also would play in the same period (""The Public Enemy,"" ""Lady Killer,"" etc.).The blondes all look similar with the short curly hair of the period and the sexism, racism and other ""isms"" are all on display here in this fun ""gangster movie."" The ending was odd but that, too, was the mark of these Pre-Code films which certainly were different.

Both men had just come off their breakthrough performances in Little Caesar and Public Enemy respectively. Of the two of them, Robinson comes off far the better.I'm not sure why Cagney did this film, more than likely because he was told to and was not yet rebelling against Jack Warner. He's strangely subdued in the part, the usual Cagney bounce and cockiness just isn't there for me. Cagney plays the best friend of Greek barber Edward G. Robinson who in his career played any number of ethnic types. Here he's a happy go lucky barber whose place doubles as a betting establishment. He likes to play, but when friends raise a bankroll for him to try his luck in the big city he gets good and clipped.Robinson's down, but not out. He goes back and clips the clippers and becomes a big gambling racketeer.

Robinson (as usual), and supporting roles by a young James Cagney and a series of blondes who will more or less look alike at first. It might have been something of a formula production for the cast and crew, but it's during the lively pre-1934 sound era where, especially at a studio like Warner Bros., things manage to pop one way or another.As much as this is a very good film, completely engaging and without gaffes or sentimental slow downs, it remains secondary for 1931 because of several interesting things. First, Robinson had just become famous for ""Little Caesar"" where he had a shining (and roughly similar) role as a sort of good guy gangster. Second, Cagney was in a rare supporting role, not yet famous for his breakout role in ""The Public Enemy"" later the same year. Both of these Warner films are better, all around. And a third twist is the appearance early on of Boris Karloff, who was about to launch to superstardom as, yes, ""Frankenstein,"" a Universal film from later in, yes, 1931.

In fact, ""Smart Money"" isn't a gangster flick per se, though it has it's seamy under world characters like Sleepy Sam (Ralf Harolde) and Hickory Short. Robinson even has a colorful handle of his own - Nick the Barber. You would think he got the name from cutting the throats of his victims, but he's actually a barber by profession, and a mighty lucky one at that. When his buddy Jack (Cagney) comes up with the idea to stake him for ten grand to go big time, Nick sees it as an opportunity to rise above his meager Irontown surroundings.That's where the story gets a little sloppy for my taste. After Nick gets hustled in 'The City', there are no repercussions over the lost grubstake back in Irontown. Word of his embarrassing loss doesn't seem to faze a new group of financial backers who raise another fifty thousand dollars, which he uses to track down Sleepy Sam in 'Another City' for revenge. I got a bit of a kick out of that actually, why not just call 'Another City' New York, since 'Walter Winchell on Broadway' headed one of his columns on the fast rising card sharp Nick the Barber. Which brings up another question - how would the results from a series of private card games ever make it into the newspaper? Robinson gets to play against a number of pretty blonds in the picture as he fancies himself a ladies man, but boy, the lines they came up with in the 1930's were something else. How about his come on to Marie early in the story - ""Say you're a cute little trick""! There's also the blatant racism of the era; when Nick tears a bill in half for the black porter on the train, he states that the other half would be ""at the other end of the line, if you're a good boy"".Back to Robinson and Cagney together in this film. I almost hate to say it, but Cagney's character was a bit swishy in the story, getting touchy feely with Nick more than once. Any doubt of the homosexual subtext to their relationship is put to rest near the end of the story when they argue over Irene (Evalyn Knapp) staying at Nick's apartment. When Jack demands to know 'how long is this gonna last?', Nick replies ""She'll be gone in a couple of days, and then you can be my sweetheart again dearie"". Do you know how many times I had to play that over to be sure I heard it right? The one thing that's kind of intriguing if you've seen some of Cagney's very first films, he had a commanding presence in those pictures even when second billed or in a bit part. Here it looks like he might have been asked to tone it down a bit in deference to his co-star. Not to say he was laid back, considering my comments above, but it didn't look like he was willing to upstage Robinson.

The next day he realises that he's been cheated with shaved cards and vows to get even with the crooks.He opens another Barber shop to raise funds for his 'rematch' and when the time comes, cheats the cheaters by using shaved cards himself, essentially becoming the Mr Big of the gambling world.However, this brings unwanted attention for the District Attorney's office who although not a gangster, murderer or even bootlegger, still views Nick as part of the City's 'undesirable' element.After helping in the rescue of a young blonde lady who's just been fished out of the river after a failed suicide attempt, Nick, who's still a kind decent man at heart takes her under his wing.

I am usually one of the first people to advise viewers not to get too offended, and accept that the movie was made in a different time where these kind of stereotypes were not considered offensive. However, Smart Money goes WAY over the top. For instance one of the black characters is named 'Suntan' and another scene on a train sees a black porter given half a bank note as a tip and then told ""You'll get the other half at the end of the line, if you're a good boy"" and worst of all, the very patronising way that Nick always rubs the hair of the black characters for luck.

Several things distinguish this film from just another mob movie. And that is just it for starters. This is not a mob movie. Edward G. Robinson's Nick is one of the kindest, most liked, and honest ""crime"" bosses you will ever see in film. Eddie doesn't shoot it up - in fact no one is murdered(Okay, I'm being a stickler here). This film also shows how difficult gambling can be as a profession. But at the film's heart is Robinson's performance. Nick is a sweet, at times naive, resilient guy with a weak/blind spot for pretty blondes. Aiding Eddie is none other than Jimmy Cagney playing Jack his friend and fellow business associate. Alfred E. Green does a rather deft job directing this very early sound picture. The pace is fast and the mood never compromised. The rest of the cast is quite good.

But, as he says, he has a weakness for women - especially blonds. That will prove his down fall.It was not the ""Little Caesar"" Robinson, but a happy-go-lucky guy that just seemed to take things as they come. he was smiling and laying odds as they carted him off to prison.

Not only does he encounter some dodgy characters but he also comes across duplicitous women, a couple of whom he falls in love with. Cagney comes to join him but can their friendship survive what is happening in the big city?It's a gentle gangster film that doesn't deliver anything too special when it comes to confrontation scenes. It's more interesting from a mystery element as to what is going on. For example, Edward G strikes up a friendship with cigarette girl Noel Francis (Marie) in a hotel but when he returns to see her the next day, she has gone. Something fishy is going on and you know she is going to re-appear at some point. All the women in this film are up to some kind of trickery so Edward G has to keep alert. It's not so much the bad guys but the bad girls that he has to watch out for.There is blatant racism in this film - rubbing a black man's head for good luck. Not just once.

Likewise with seeing James Cagney, also at his best in the type of film 'Smart Money' falls under, in his only film with Robinson. Have always liked films that have gritty subjects and gives them the tough approach, and there are numerous extremely good and even classic films of this kind from the 30s and 40s.'Smart Money' didn't disappoint to me, and while not what one calls an upbeat film it was so good to see a film that was more than very solidly executed and made the utmost of the talent it had on display. Amidst such a terrible time in the world and it eased the unsettlement at a time where a distraction was very much needed. It is a smart film, the title is absolutely apt, and appropriately tough as it absolutely should be considering the kind of story it has.There is very little to dislike here. The plot may not be anything out of the ordinary and can get predictable at times.Ending is slightly on the pat side.All that is completely outweighed by the positives. 'Smart Money' is stylishly and moodily made, as well as solidly if not always exceptionally directed (successful in keeping the tension and intrigue going). It is hard to dislike the smart and sharp dialogue, that is full of amusement and edge with the odd touch of irony. While the story is not one that blows the socks off, it's very neatly done with a fast pace and enough neat turns. It is suspenseful too and has the right amount of toughness.Supporting cast are good, Ralf Harolde's menacing Sleepy Sam and the small role of Boris Karloff (in just one of the films in a prolific year for him) standing out. Cagney's part is not massive, but it plays to his strengths and he plays it with real commitment and tremendous energy, even if it is not one of the most intense performances he ever gave.

After awhile though, his whole past comes back to him when his son unknowingly meets his mother and develops a bond with her. Conflict between him and his wife rises and we see even deeper into what was a merely a shell of his life in the beginning of the film; he is complicated and emotionally bruised man, snapping sometimes at his son that he loves with all his heart.The film has the most believable performances I have ever seen on screen, and is a tearjerker. But it doesn't try to make you cry once; the entire second half of the film is full of these scenes. Some work while others don't. Either way, it shows the true power and delicacy of unconditional love, and the way it ends leaves you gasping for breath because of the emotional impact it leaves.

tt0078950,The Champ is One-Dimensional,5.0,"¨We did some silly things. Who knows why people do what they do? Nobody knows that, but she's... she's a good person.¨ The Champ has divided audiences over the world; there are those who consider this to be a masterpiece and others who believe it's just a terrible movie that tries too hard to be a tearjerker. I wouldn't agree with either statement, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it isn't terrible either. It has it's touching moments with a good performance from Jon Voight as the lead actor. I did have some issues with the child actor, Rick Schroder, but it had more to do with the material he had to work with than anything else. The producers tried too hard in making him look so cute that his character lost credibility. This 1979 film, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is actually a remake of a 1931 movie of the same name directed by King Vidor and written by Frances Marion. So remakes have been a part of Hollywood for years now, it's not something new like many people might think. The screenplay for this film was adapted by Walter Newman and in my opinion it is the weakest part of the movie. The script doesn't feel real, it is overly dramatic and I just couldn't make sense of several scenes. For example, there is one scene where Voight's character abandons his son in a boxing gym to grab some drinks in a bar. The kid ends up alone trying to figure out where his father went and deduces he is probably at a nearby bar. I know there might be some parents that would do this, but I doubt they could have raised their child as well as Schroder's character seems to have been raised. His love and passion for his father, the champ, is hard to believe because he seems so selfish and cruel at times.The story takes place in Hialeah where Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), a former boxing champ now in his late thirty's, is working as a race horse trainer. He lives with his seven year old son, T.J. (Rick Schroder), who absolutely worships his father and calls him the champ. Billy raises his son on his own since his mother abandoned them when T.J. was born, although he has told his son that she passed away. T.J. seems to be more mature then his father and is always cleaning after his mess. Billy dreams of making a comeback in boxing, but he suffered a head injury that made him abandon the sport. He also is a compulsive gambler and alcoholic. One day he even steals money from his son's allowance in order to gamble. This time however, Billy wins a lot of money and decides to buy his son a race horse after feeling guilty for what he did. T.J. names his horse ""She's A Lady"" and takes her to the race tracks where he meets a lovely woman named Annie (Faye Dunaway). When Annie runs into Billy she realizes that T.J. is the son she has abandoned and now wants to make up for what she has done. Annie is a successful designer who is married to a wealthy doctor. At first Billy doesn't want anything to do with her and insists in not letting his son know she's alive, but due to his gambling problems he will be forced to. The only solution Billy can think of in order to give his son a better future is returning to what he does best: boxing.The Champ relies too heavily on the dramatic effect and that is what ends up hurting the movie because many scenes seem to fit the screenplay for the convenience of the movie and it just doesn't feel real. There are some strong scenes, which I agree were well acted like the prison scene or the final scene, but there were others that felt phony and overacted, like the scene where T.J. screams at Annie in the boat. My biggest disappointment was that I felt T.J. to be a one dimensional character. He was there to make the movie look cute and make the audience sympathize with him. Billy, on the other hand, was a character we sometimes despised and at others loved and identified with. Audiences that enjoy heartfelt films and tearjerkers will probably love this movie, but audiences who are searching for more character depth will probably be disappointed with it. I had a hard time with the beginning of the film, and found the last half of the movie more entertaining, but it is far from being the masterpiece some people claim it to be.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6,15,False
tt0078950,"'Sport, Fathers and Death' the holy trinity for tears",10.0,"I don't remember the name of the journalist who spoke this statement, but I want to say a big amen to that, as my saddest movie involves all these three factors, I know they might sound a little too male-oriented but I'm pretty sure it at least touched upon two branches of this trinity for female audiences, can't women also respond to the sight of a little grief-stricken boy inconsolably crying over the loss of his father, and making grown-up men weep as well? I want to open this review by saying that ""The Champ"" holds a very special place in my heart, if only because it might be the first live-action movie I remember seeing as a (6-year old) kid, and for some strange reason, of all the scenes from the film, I was more impacted by the sight of blood, a disturbing novelty for my kiddies' eyes (the sparring partner, the horse's injury and the scary sight of Billy's opponent shouting at him). 4 years later, I saw it and every one was bawling in the TV room, everyone but me, mostly amused by these reactions. The Youtube clips many years later finally had their effect, but even then I knew I had to experience the whole film to measure up the extent of its emotionality.So I did and I can't believe someone who despises the overuse of superlatives like me would indulge himself to such a clichéd statement but this is indeed the saddest movie ever, with the climactic locker-room scene as the most defining moment. Adapted from a 1931 movie directed by King Vidor, ""The Champ"", is about a father-and-son relationship, an extraordinary sacred link between Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), an ex-Heavyweight Boxing Champion who reconverted in horse-training, and his 8-year old blond-haired angel-faced son: T.J. (Ricky Shroeder). To say that T.J. loves his father would be a huge understatement; he literally worships him to the point of calling him 'Champ' instead of 'Dad'. I can recall considering my father a true model when I was a kid, I can easily respond to the sight of a kid who admires his father the way T.J. does, especially since this adoration is the build-up that cements the final scene's emotionality.A few words about Ricky Schroeder's performance: it's absolutely refreshing to see a child acting like a real one, not too mature or annoying, Ricky Shroeder delivers in ""The Champ"" one of the finest pieces of child acting ever, on the same vein than Jackie Coogan in ""The Kid"", any kids' performance pale in comparison to little Ricky that year and I can't believe his performance was overlooked by the Academy Awards (while he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Male Newcomer). The irony is that the same year, an even younger kid was nominated for a similar role; it was Justin Henry as Billy in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". I guess Henry was favored in regard of the film's commercial success and the fact that his character was more 'complex', but let's face it, even Justin Henry wouldn't claim to have made millions of people all over the world cry like Ricky did.The parallel with ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" can be extended to the father and boy's situation. The mother Annie (Faye Dunaway) left, Billy had the custody and every thing went fine, despite some financial and gambling problems, until Annie showed up again and expressed her desire to take part again in her son's life, her son who thinks his mother died. The film takes then the emotional start with the most simple plot premise and it only avoid cliché's annoyances thanks to the beautiful performance of Ricky Schroeder. Indeed, every single moment work and it almost seems like the adult actors did their best to match Ricky's incredible acting, and I believe that Jon Voight deserved more accolades for his performance.The film contains some of the most emotional moments you'll ever see, reaching a first pinnacle with three powerful scenes in a row: a heart-breaking father-and-son conversation in jail, T.J. learning that Annie is not a ""little angel in the sky"" and his outburst of enraged cries when she can't even say that she loves 'Champ', and then the reunion with Billy, hell even the happier moments are unbelievably sad, with little T.J. and his father swimming on the beach (mirroring a previous scene with Annie). It's so effective that I dare even the most skeptical movie viewers to label this film as manipulative. Franco Ziffereli's directing is relatively sober and the music not too over-emotional, so if anything is manipulative, then it has to be a little 8-year old actor's performance, would you believe he'd have this intention? To conclude, I sincerely don't think any film would have as a powerful emotional impact as ""The Champ""'s final scene. Sticking with my own conviction, I even googled the title of the film and the words 'saddest ever' and to my pleasant surprise, I discovered that some scientists after many studies found out that the film could be considered as the saddest ever from the way people were immediately responding to its most emotional scenes (notably the final one). Many readers mentioned titles such as ""Bambi"", ""Brian's Song"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Grave of the Fireflies"" but I think they missed the point of the study which was less about giving a title than determining the most likely film to induce one particular reaction among the majority, in that case: crying.I remember my father told me that after watching the film in the theater, everyone was weeping and sneezing, he recommended the film to his toughest friends challenging them not to cry, but at the end, they were all bawling like little girls. Like it or not, it deserves the title of 'emotional masterpiece' and I don't think any rational critic will convince me to give it a 'reasonable' rating.",10,14,True
tt0078950,One of my all time favorite movies.,10.0,"This movie has been accused of being overly-sentimental. That's probably true. Nonetheless, I am unable to watch this movie without crying. Jon Voight plays an ex-boxing champion raising his young boy (played by a stellar Ricky Schroder). I think Jon Voight is very good in this film (and I'm not a huge Jon Voight fan), and I think the young Schroder (who was seven, I believe, when he made this film) is fantastic. I find Faye Dunaway (who plays the boy's estranged mother) slightly annoying, but I forgive her because I love the film itself so much. I think Franco Zefferelli's direction is superb, and I enjoy much of the cinematography. I think the relationship between Voight and Schroder is particularly touching, and there are several scenes between them that bring me to tears. I really do give this movie a ten.",8,14,False
tt0078950,The Champ (1979),2.0,"Directed by Franco Zeffirelli. Starring Jon Voight, Rick Schroeder, Faye Dunaway, Arthur Hill, Jack Warden, Joan Blondell, Strother Martin, Elisha Cook Jr. (PG)Schlocky sentimentalism in the form of a remake of a 1931 movie that was pretty lousy to begin with. Here, young Schroeder is hopelessly attached to his pop, an aging galoot of a boxer (Voight, miscast); then here comes absentee mom Dunaway, and another opportunity to get in the ring, and...well, even if there weren't at least three versions of this same story floating around out there (one of them called ""The Clown""), would it be possible to not see every plot point coming? Less a tearjerker than a tearwrencher, but its persistence is parodic, and there's nothing here that feels grounded or resonant; if the script didn't insist it was true, would anyone believe that Voight and Dunaway's characters were ever in a previous relationship? Showing up late in the proceedings as a trainer, not even Warden can save this off-putting would-be tragedy. Schroeder, who cries enough to refill the dolphin tank at SeaWorld, often expresses himself with a one-word vocabulary, and his every utterance feels like a right cross to the ear. Positioned at the end of the 70s, Dunaway's performance seems designed as a way to bid farewell to her reputable years--now it's time for ""Mommie Dearest"" and ""Supergirl""!19/100",5,13,False
tt0078950,Euro + Hollywood = failure,4.0,"""The Champ"" is a weird amalgamation of European style film-making with Hollywood pathos.Going in, I knew it was a boxing movie about a relationship between a washed up ex-champ and his little boy, and of course the champ gets another chance and it's going to culminate in a big fight.What I didn't know expect is that it takes over an hour to really get there. There's a lot of boring rubbish leading up to the Hollywood stuff you're waiting for: tedium, European style.The movie spends a long time setting up this former ""champ""'s current life, working at a race track with horses, and palling around with his little boy. In fact it does more than set it up. It establishes it as a real place. But why? Who cares?This just seemed unnecessary.Eventually we get to the Hollywood crap, which is actually pretty sub par. Maybe it's just because the movie's baggy first half totally undercuts the rest of it. Hollywood movies need to be taut to generate suspense and stop you from getting boredThis is supposed to be one of the saddest movies ever made.

tt0078950,Has-Been's Comeback,2.0,"""The Champ"" is the most disgraceful sort of manipulative melodrama. A pointless remake of a has-been 1931 film of the same name, this one pummels its audience--employing filmic techniques developed since the original--in its comeback to try to inflict even more tears than its saccharine predecessor.The 1931 version is bad, but at least the camerawork allowed some distance for the actors to develop a decent father-son bond on screen before the hokey histrionics are punched up. Not so here--zoom-ins, especially on the kid and mother, and a greater emphasis on close-ups force the audience to see every tear in the characters' eyes and, the filmmakers' hope seems to be, likewise force the waterworks out of viewers, as well. To today's eyes, at least, even the look and any deterioration of the 1970s film stock has the appearance of being filmed through a teary lens. Moreover, there are a greater series of crying scenes in the remake before the finale compared to the original. Early talkies, such as the 1931 ""The Champ,"" also didn't feature non-diegetic musical scores. This 1979 remake, however, adds one, which rarely allows a moment without informing us what we're supposed to feel. This manipulative music was nominated for an Oscar. It's bad enough that there was never anything intelligent or particularly interesting from Frances Marion's script, another inexplicable Oscar honoree, but the remake doesn't even allow for any genuine emotional involvement. Every time I felt the film's machinations working, it inevitably left me feeling betrayed and abandoned, like T.J. ultimately is at some point by both parents.Padding is added to the narrative, compared to the original, to allow for the heightened sentimental shenanigans. The original also had an injury at the horse track that foreshadows the film's finale, but this one adds more clutter there. I don't get the Old Tom Parr reference, either. Given the ending, is that supposed to be ironic? There are also two swimming scenes with T.J. and another pointless scene where we watch the father watching children playing on a beach (c'mon, we already know he likes kids). With star Faye Dunaway in the role, the part of the mother is expanded, too. It's over an hour and a half before the Champ begins training for his comeback--a length longer than the entire 1931 film.In the wake of ""Rocky"" (1976), the boxing scene in the 1979 ""The Champ"" is certainly better than that in the 1931 version, which might be the most laughably-pathetic boxing contest ever filmed, and there's a brief Rocky-esque training montage. Wallace Berry, another undeserving Oscar winner, was literally unfit for the role of a former heavyweight champion. At least, Jon Voight was in better physical shape, and he doesn't ludicrously lunge forward, throwing haymakers each round. Jack Warden, who played a similar role in the prior year's ""Heaven Can Wait,"" another pointless sports-related remake, is brought in as the Champ's trainer, although he's introduced rather late in the feature--seemingly relying on his credibility from the prior film instead of developing his character here.Part of the surge in boxing films piggybacking on the success of ""Rocky,"" ""The Champ"" also seems to somewhat anticipate the anti-Feminist message of ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" released later in 1979, by focusing on a father-son relationship under threat from the re-emergence of the mother who abandoned them. Yet, it's shallow on both accounts, boxing and child custody. Emotional manipulation is the contest of concern here. Hopefully, you come out unscathed.",4,12,False
tt0078950,It was Great!,9.0,"This movie is a real gem. ""The Champ"" is like the modern-day version of ""Paper Moon"". Only closer to the heart.

It was shocking to see a 9-year-old say ""bullsh--"" good and loud. I wondered who made him say that. Then there's the beach scene which is memorable. They were going for a swim in the ocean, and he tells his son, ""Pull up your trunks, we ain't getting arrested for nude bathing!"" Father and son should have family time every time and Billy has did his best being a good father the best he can. Though champion will fall down at times, that doesn't mean he's a total loser. He was born a champion, and will die a champion. He did just that. T.J. denied his death, he may just do that, but he knows he's alive in one place that can never die, His heart.

I would expect the writers and producers of this show to be savvy enough to know that they have viewers from all over the world and from all walks of life. This scene is not only racist, but it perpetuates stereotypes that black people to this day are still trying to overcome.

I spent the entire series being frustrated and wanting to hit the writer really hard. 😳 I had been looking at this series for several months because Viki always seemed to be recommending it, but I was hesitant because it's 52 episodes. It started well and was initially funny albeit highly prejudicial. One thing that I love about Korean dramas is that the characters always get what's coming to them. In this series, you're waiting way too long for that and you're forced to endure ridiculous plot lines full of screaming, scheming, crying and characters allowing abuse to happen. In every plot line, the parents severely interfere with their children's lives to the extent that the children become more mature than the adults who are continually throwing temper tantrums and scheming to break up or force their children's relationships for their own selfish reasons. Seeing the parents happy after tearing apart their children's relationships was incredibly difficult to watch. I would have told my family to take a flying flip off a rolling doughnut from the get go! I wonder if the actors had trouble acting those ridiculous scenes? I certainly would have. 🙄 The children were great and I really liked the 2 leads. I thought they all had great chemistry. By episode 38 though, I started forwarding through most scenes that didn't involve the main characters because the other scenes were too embarrassing to watch and all promises were empty ones. So much drama over a 14 year age gap and a fraudulent engagement. It is the most frustrating and convoluted story I have ever watched.

tt15514606,"Loved Dan-dan, Young-suk & his kids relationship!",8.0,"SPOILER ALERT;This drama is actually good, the main plot is love between a wealthy older man Young-souk who has 3 wonderful kids & a young lady Dan-dan who ends up as a live-in tutor. Their love is genuine but full of obstacles from all sides except for the youngest and middle son who give their blessing.They get together & break off a couple of times. Most women would give up & move on when the guy is mean, use harsh words & gives her the cold shoulder. It took Dan-dan the harsh truth to see Young-suk with another woman to let go the relationship.The BEST is the relationship between dan-dan & young-yuk kids. The kids lost their mom at an early age so they bonded easily& fast to Dan-dan who is thoughtful, protects & shows them love. The youngest kid is so adorable & the non-stop tears when he gets so attached & suffers separation anxiety to Dan-dan. The middle kid is the love genius,, he accepts Dan-dan as his mom from the start, he supports the relationship 100% nearly from the start. You end up understanding why the oldest daughter is against it but mostly she accepts the tutor & father relationship.When the 5 of them are together, they look like a real family, so cute, natural & genuine love for each other!Then there are supporting plots- the love of an older lady Se-ryeon & a younger man Dae-beom, there are lots of complications as they both are from 2 different social standing, one being rich & the other poor. Their love story is so wonderful, sweet & they behave like cute puppies! Se-ryeon is not only beautiful especially when she wears those beautiful wedding dresses! She glows! There is nothing to hate her in this drana but just loves her even more!The best scenes are when Dan-dan, Young-suk & the 3 kids outings! Even the fantastic new housekeeper Ms Kim! She is awesome!The sad scenes are the multiples breaking up between Dan-dan & Young-suk, the betrayed from Dan-dan father, biological mom, the breaking up between Se-ryeon & Dae-beom, the 2 young boys missing Dan-dan.The worst scenes are the horrifying attitudes of Young-suk stepmom/his father mistress! She is despicable! The despicable housekeeper Sa-ra, the level of deception is truly unbelievable!Dan- Dan father is when you love him for protecting his daughter but at the same time you hates him for being cruel.Dan-dan stepmom you appreciates her for being a mom for Dan-dan but you hate her for being a gold digger, money-minded & thoughtless.They cry alot in the show!The sub plot is too much and the length is too draggy. Ends up like fast forward irrelevant scenes to check the happy ending.There could be more hugs, kisses real ones not peck on the lips, look at each other eyes before kissing, real romantic scenes, better beautiful body flattering & hair style wedding gowns for Dan-dan.The rest sub-plots are like the relationship between Dae-beom uncle & Sa-ra, Sa-ra mom & her, Sa-ra mom & her neighbbour/friend/landlord. Dan-dan father & long lost sister who actually Sa-ra moms neighbour, the 2 cousins, those are just too lengthy draggy scenes& ends up fast forward. Too much talking which makes them irrelevant.

I don't know why wasted so much time on this. I loved the kids though, they are the only ones worth watching on this show. At first the main character Dandan was tolerable. Then she started crying buckets of tears for something so petty. Really bad acting. Bad scriptwriting. Bad direction. Such a waste of time.",2,2,False
tt15514606,Fast forward and never look back,1.0,"I understand that the positive reviews come from people who can value this show as extreme satire - I suppose it could be funny if you look at it that way. However, I was expecting a romcom. This show is more like slapstick and absurdity. Dan-dan, the main character, is a whining immature girl, who fortunately knows how to connect with the children. I don't see why she would fall for their stick-up-his-arse father. The fact that he likes a young new leaf in his house is more understandable, but also a bit creepy. I would have found it much more logical if he had married the mother of his youngest son, who is also working for him and is actually reaching out to him. It would have been much more satisfying to me if they had gotten together. Or there was another lovely lady, who works WITH him, who would have been a perfect match for him. But no, he falls for the young, uneducated girl.Dan-dan should have found another man, but I suppose in heart she is a gold digger like her stepmother family and her real mother. Which makes it even more irritating that she pretends to have such high morals. She is extremely harsh towards her stepmother and I feel she is just an unthankful, selfish girl. And actually, although she has a good relationship with the children, I don't think she is a good example to them.For a good romcom, there are simply too few men and too many women in this show. And practically all those women are screaming and/or crying. I think the main lead's father's mistress, who lives in the house, is being mistreated. She is portrayed as being the bad woman, but I feel for her and can understand she has grudges. I think if I were the writer, the characters would have had very different storylines with very different outcomes. And out of necessity, I would have thrown in a few interesting men. The scenes with the two women living together I soon started too fast forward, as they consisted of yelling only. After a while, I started to fast forward the rest of the show so it would no longer be suggested for further watching in my Netflix app. I do not want too look back, but perhaps this is like a scab on a wound that you keep scratching. Hopefully, after writing this review, this wound will heal.",1,2,False
tt15514606,The secondary couples are more interesting than the main couple,7.0,"This popular family drama provides lots of laughs and a story that keeps you watching for 52 episodes. But it's actually the supporting cast and secondary romances that are more interesting than the main couple. The story centers around a widower and his kid's nanny. The main couple has a relationship that goes back and forth too many times that it becomes frustrating. In contrast, the secondary relationships like the wealthy girl Se Ryeon and poor boy Dae Boem and Mr Teddy Bear and Jo Sa Ra have a more compelling involving love story. The themes of class difference and age gap are the big issues here. And the writer does a good job at showing these with lots of humor throughout. In fact this writer wrote My Love By My Side, one of my favorite shows of all time.A big shout out to the excellent supporting cast like Cha Hwa Yeon who plays the stepmother of the Chairman. She gets an over the top comic role that shows all the money madness that many mistresses have. Her pretty daughter played by Yoon Jin Yi is really lovely and acts so well - she ought to be a lead actress. The main villainess is the crafty and persistent Jo Sa Ra played by Park Ha Na. She is one of the top antagonists in K drama land for sure. The kids are great and can move you to tears. The mothers are all good and many K drama fans would recognize them from other shows. Their fights are hilarious. As for the main couple Ji Hyun Woo does quite a good job of playing Chairman Lee who has so much to shoulder from a crazy step mother to an insane womn in love with him. He does act quite differently and young when he gets amnesia. Lee Se Hee as Park Dam Dam the heroine can by annoying at times but at least she changes from martyr to fighter and becomes likeable towards the end. She isn't the most beautiful actress but she tries hard. Her expressions are a bit similar and repetitive.In the end I enjoyed this series because of the laughs. It would be better if it had been shortened by a few episodes. Often a character would say something and the other person would repeat it. Also there are too many tears and too much parental objection to relationships. But if you are looking for an entertaining family drama this one is quite good for killing time.",2,2,True

You see and hear things you would NEVER see or hear on the silver screen today. Some of that is good; some it too corny for words, some of it bad (depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues.)For instance, in this short (68 minutes) 1931 film you have:The grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the United States (picture that in today's films!)A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent (once again, picture that in modern-day movies.) Along the way you have some shocking violence, such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet, and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head-first into a wall. This is a tough stuff, to say the least. Yet the film is dotted with comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandpa, memorably played by Charles ""Chic"" Sales. There are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film. And, for soft touches, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day. Here, he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who, understandably, is far from being a polished actor, but you can see stardom for him on the horizon. In fact, he did just that the following year with a solid performance in ""Blonde Venus,"" starring Marlene Dietrich.Anyway, this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence, comedy and sentimentality....and it has a nice feel-good ending and a thought-provoking message. It was up for an Academy Award, too, for ""Best Writing, Original Story.""

Walter Huston, looking bored, is the frustrated DA, and the ""average American family"" includes such familiar faces as Sally Blane (looking a lot like her sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. Both are regularly crowded out of the frame by Chic Sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian Civil War veteran, ponderously jumping and ""amusingly"" nipping at Prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're Americans, dag nabbit.

But the granddaddy of them all is, well, Granddaddy. As played by Chic Sale (in full ""Dag-nabbit!"" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about ""dang, dirty foreigners"" for good measure. If these are the good guys, it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.Not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating Leeds family. The incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. Only Walter Huston, as the district attorney, elevates the cliché-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.The film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.",6,15,False

While sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. The mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.The rest of the movie consists of Walter Huston as the crusading DA occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. It all winds up in a predictable manner.Good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous Sue Blane in a small role as the Leeds daughter.

In fact, I would have liked to drop his hat several times - with his head in it.

Everything about it is so dated, it's hard to recommend it as anything but a museum piece. (Trivia note: DICKIE MOORE was one cute kid as the littlest brother).I never heard of CHARLES ""CHIC"" SALE before, but he makes an insufferable grandpa, the dad of GRANT WITHERS. ""Blood's thicker than government pea coup"" is one of his most clichéd statements. The opening scene has the family gathered for a dinner interrupted by gunfire. Seems that a man on his way to see the D.A. was gunned down by underworld gangsters.With the family witnessing the whole thing, the story turns on just when and whether the star witnesses will testify. Unfortunately, the bare plot outline sounds better than it plays. The sentiment is so thick involving gramps and the little kids and there are so many inconsequential moments with weak attempts at humor, that the whole story falls apart long before the predictable ending.Hard to see how William A.

""This is the fight of every decent man!"" so that the drama has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.Summing up: Just a curiosity piece of vintage film-making but hardly worth a peek.

tt0022430,Cute Dickie Moore is the Real Scene Stealer!!!,9.0,"In 1931 Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making gangster movies. Warner Bros. had led the way with it's grimly realistic ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"" but behind this about face Warners were about to launch the next vogue - the social conscious movie. To show that they were serious, William Wellman started shooting ""The Star Witness"" as a companion piece to ""The Public Enemy"" to show the effect the witnessing of an underworld slaying has on an ordinary family. And believe me the gangsters are low and rough. The beating that Pa Leeds received was shocking and confronting and when Donny was kidnapped he was thrown around like a sack of potatoes - these hoodlums were real and had no redeeming features. They leave no doubt that little Donny will be killed after the trial.The Leeds are a typical family (of any year). Jackie (Eddie Nugent) is unemployed and thinks he knows it all, Pa (Grant Mitchell) is constantly reminding him that he doesn't. To top it all, one evening, in the middle of tea, Grandpa (""Chick"" Sales) pays an unwelcome visit where his long winded stories about the Civil War bore everyone to death - except the two little boys, Donny and Ned (cute little Dickie Moore). Suddenly the middle of the street explodes with gunfire and the Leeds witness a gangland slaying. Gangster kingpin Maxey Campo (Ralph Ince) threatens them with ""If you finger me, I'll use your guts for wallpaper""!! - pretty nasty stuff!!! D.A. Whitlock (Walter Huston) is determined that the family will testify but after Pa is severely beaten and little Donny is kidnapped, even under police protection - the last thing the family want to do is to antagonise the gangsters.All except Grandpa, who will not be intimidated. This movie showed Grandpa as part of an older, more idealistic generation who will not be swayed from their duty. His speeches were in the ""America for Americans"" vein and he often referred to gangsters as ""yellow bellied foreigners"". It was obviously retaliation on the movie's part for the abundance of gangster movies that had a distinct ethnic flavour. ""Chic"" Sale's, who would have been right at home in a Frank Capra movie, manner and look were too comical to have an emotional impact. Unlike other reviewers who thought his shenanigans stole the movie, I don't agree. Little Dickie Moore, I definitely think was the real scene stealer - he was so cute and unaffected. A character actor like Charley Grapewin who could play old codgers for laughs or dramatic intensity was what was needed. To see how it could be done you have only to view ""The Night of June 13th"" (1932) - in it Charley played a similar character, a crusty old grandpa who is the eyes and ears of a quiet suburban street. When a neighbour is found dead, he is the only person not too frightened to take the witness stand and testify on behalf of accused Clive Brook - you are literally hanging on his every word.Even though I did think ""Chic"" Sale was annoying, his role in ""The Star Witness"" was designed to show that old timers had a lot to give in terms of patriotism and duty. His ""can do"" attitude has him finding the kidnapper's lair and calling the police force to action before all the new fangled phone tracing gets a chance. Driving beside a cemetery, Grandpa muses about his fallen comrades and the cinema viewer was left to think about what would become of America when men like Grandpa were gone.",5,7,True
tt0022430,Early Warners talkie starring Walter Huston,5.0,"When a family witnesses a murder, and some of them can identify the killer, their lives become terrifying in ""Star Witness,"" a 1931 Warner Brothers film starring the great Walter Huston, Sally Blane, Dickie Hugent and Chic Sale. It will be hard for a 21st century audience to believe this movie was nominated for an Oscar for original story, since we've seen it dozens of times since. Also, with a film like this, it's hard to envision it the way a 1931 audience did. Unfortunately for ""Star Witness,"" it's just not one of those movies that has stood the test of time.Nevertheless, this 76-year-old film is interesting in that it tells us a lot about America, families, movie-making, and writing in the early '30s. Huston plays the DA in charge of the case. This role bears no resemblance to Dodsworth, but the way the part is written is worth noting. Even in books in the 1930s, including the original Perry Mason books, characters were given to big, declamatory speeches, as Huston's character is in this film. Apparently this was part of the writing style in fashion - and that style dates any movie faster than the sight of an old car in one of the scenes.The family unit consists of two little boys, plus an adult, working daughter who still lives at home, and an adult son (Frank Nugent) who is, for all intents and purposes, a bum. Of interest - the beautiful, marriage-age daughter (Sally Blane, Loretta Young's sister) doesn't have her own place. It wasn't done back then - what would that say about her; also, she needed to contribute to the family income. And the gap in the children's ages? Not unusual. As in my own family, women back then often had many pregnancies and either miscarried or the babies died.Chic Sale, all of 57 at the time of filming, plays what has to be the world's oldest man, Grandpa, a very annoying character who talks about his love of America, standing up to foreigners and not letting them take over the country. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it? Seventy-six years later, there are still people saying that.A big shootout scene toward the end of the film was reminiscent of many other film shootouts in the early days - people shot guns without taking any particular aim. The effect they went for back then seems to be just making as much smoke as possible. Shooters keep the guns close to their waists and just shoot like blind men.So despite what seems like a routine crime drama with some over the top characters and bratty kids, ""Star Witness"" still has a few things to offer, if only to show us that while lots has changed, a few things haven't, and that what was original in 1931 seems like it's by the numbers in 2007.

The second is that in escaping he did a brief home invasion of your average American family who are now mostly witnesses to the crime he committed. But getting them to tell their story is the subject of this film and it's what District Attorney Walter Huston has to do.You can't get much more average than the Leeds family. Father and mother Grant Mitchell and Frances Starr, children, Sally Blane, Edward Nugent, George Ernest, and Dickie Moore. And they have their maternal grandfather Chic Sale living with them as well. He's the only one that wants to do his civic duty and hence he's Huston's Star Witness.Sale has a really great part as the feisty old Civil War veteran and he steals every scene he's in, even from Walter Huston. He also speaks some of the more ethnocentric lines that mirror the view that The Star Witness takes about foreigners coming in to ruin this country. That was not an uncommon view of what Middle America thought of the urban gangsters who seem to come up from nowhere during those Prohibition days.The Leeds family endures a lot, a beating to one family member and a kidnapping of another. The film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. And the shootout with the gang and law enforcement is one of the best that Warner Brothers did at the time.

But, interestingly, Mr. Sale (as ""Gramps"") seems to put his ""country"" over his grandson, and agrees to become ""The Star Witness"".

tt0022430,The Birth of a Cliché,5.0,"If you love seeing Walter Huston being the epitome of integrity, the most upright and honest American of all time, the defender of civilisation delivering passionate moralising monologues about doing the right thing, this is your movie!Along with James Cagney and Joan Blondell, nobody else epitomises the feel of the early thirties better than Walter Huston. Although in this he's almost a caricature of himself (how can anyone be this sincere!) he is still undoubtedly Mr Thirties so if you love films from this time, you've got to love him in this. This picture was actually Oscar nominated for best original story - watching this today laden with every single movie cliché ever conceived you'll wonder if they were having a laugh but clichés had to originate somewhere - in 1931 this was new, fresh and original.Director William Wellman who also made his classics: THE PUBLIC ENEMY and NIGHT NURSE this same year displays the same imagination and flair to make this engaging and thoroughly enjoyable. As you'd expect, it's interestingly filmed and being made at Warner Brothers where they couldn't afford to waste a single inch of film on anything that wasn't telling the story, it bombs along like a rocket. You couldn't find a better example of something which can effortlessly whisk you off to 1931, it gives what seems like a genuine authentic feel of 1931 or at least how people in 1931 thought of themselves. Unlike most of Wellman's films from the early thirties, this one feels the creakiest and that's probably because it focuses not on a couple of lead characters but on a whole family. A running time of just over an hour isn't long enough to get to know everyone......and furthermore, you probably wouldn't want to get to know them anyway.The Leeds family, who are the unfortunate folk who become the star witnesses, represent a typical urban American family. They were clearly authentic otherwise audiences back then would not have accepted this as a film about 'people like us' however they are just horrible! Grant Mitchell (not the one from EastEnders) is his usual supercilious, unpleasant self. Whoever plays ""Ma"" is just so limp and simpering that you're secretly wishing James Cagney would appear and sock her in the mouth (she's the drudging housewife stereotype who removes her husband's shoes when he comes home from work and then puts slippers on his feet - a tradition in want of reviving.) There's also a grown up layabout son who's also a really, really terrible actor. There's two very young boys (the irritatingly cute one and the mischievous tyke we're apparently supposed to find amusing). There's also a grown up daughter who's Loretta Young's sister and there's Grandpa. Grandpa is played by a 1920 Vaudeville comic called Chic Sale....... some reviewers suggest he's the worst thing about this film but I actually quite liked him. For 1931, it's quite a dark film and without disrupting the narrative, his cartoon-like character adds a bit of colour and fun. The problem with this film is this family - you can't warm to them so despite of the attention to detail, the action and the tension Mr Wellman imbues, you don't care about them.In summary, you couldn't care less whether the whole lot of them (apart from Sally Blane of course) become part of the foundations to the new Empire State building but conversely you've got a well made and interesting picture (extremely well made for 1931) with Walter Huston being more Walter Huston than you can imagine. So on balance does this make for a good film? Sadly not quite - without empathy for the characters it fails but it's still worth watching.",3,4,False

There's suspense, an Oscar-nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to beit is here. I do question Chic Sales performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot. He's treated to special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. must have really been high on Sale, but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me. Perhaps it is lost to time period, an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand. Also, the climax is typically melodramatic.

Right in front of their front door, two men are gunned down by mobsters in cold blood, and the whole family sees it. An unlocked door gets the gangsters inside their cosy dining room, followed by threats of great violence. Father Grant Mitchell finds himself on the side of that violence in a very shocking way, as does one of the younger sons (George Ernest) who is kidnapped and mistreated by literally being tossed into a closet as if he was a filthy coat. Grandpa Charles ""Chic"" Sale is the key witness, but questions in regards to his sobriety at the time threaten to destroy the case, lead by D.A. Walter Huston.This is a variation of the type of family horror drama that would be later detailed and played out in the Broadway play and subsequent movie, ""The Desperate Hours"", although here, the family's safety is threatened by gangsters who don't hold them hostage. In a sense, it's even more tense, because father Mitchell can't even go to a business meeting without the worry of being nabbed, and the kids (which includes Dickie Moore) can't go to school without fear of being taken hostage. The great William Wellman directs with his usual flair and no nonsense style, and the performances are all superb, with Sale having several great moments of going off on grandson Eddie Nugent who wants to kowtow to the gangsters simply for the family's safety rather than stand up for what's right.

An important historic event intervened between the two: the Hays Code became rigidly enforced in 1934. The 1932 version is much spicier.  Mary, the unknown knockout in in the 1932 version, is a saucy waitress at the legendary Brown Derby restaurant trying to catch the eye of a movie big shot. She's pretty  sophisticated and, you believe, would happily do whatever is required to land an acting job.  She readily allows herself to be picked up and taken to a premiere by a famous (but fading) director, which launches her great career.  In the 1937 version, Esther, the ingenue, is straight off the farm and comes to Hollywood without a clue about the movie biz.  She's a goody-two-shoes who would be shocked about what it usually takes to break into the biz.  She catches the eye of a famous (but fading and highly alcoholic) actor when she waitresses at a party.There is one major plot difference:  in the 1932 version, Mary marries a rich polo playing socialite who divorces her (while she's pregnant) because he is fed up with movie people.  This is highly realistic--movie stars had terrible marital problems.  In the 1937 version, Esther marries the actor who was her mentor and is sucked into his hopeless downward spiral. Divorce is a perfectly acceptable solution to marital problems in 1932 but, under the constraints of the Code, was out of the question in 1937.Both films are well worth seeing.

Lowell Sherman, himself both a director and an alcoholic, played the sad role that had been modeled, in part, on his own life. (Sherman's brother-in-law, John Barrymore, was also a model, as was the silent film director Marshall Neilan.) The divinely beautiful Constance Bennett plays the ambitious Brown Derby waitress who grabs her chance. Neil Hamilton, paired to great effect with Bennett that same year in ""Two Against the World,"" plays the east-coast polo-playing millionaire who captures Bennett's heart without ever understanding her world.George Cukor directed the film for RKO, and already the seeds of his directorial genius can be seen. Wonderful montages and double exposures chart Bennett's rise and fall as ""America's Pal,"" and I've rarely seen anything as moving as the way Cukor presented Sherman's death scene, using quick shot editing, exaggerated sound effects and a slow motion shot. As startling as it looks today, one can only imagine the reaction it must have caused over 70 years earlier, before audiences had become accustomed to such techniques.While the romantic leads are solid--Bennett, as always, especially so--and Gregory Ratoff is mesmerizing as the producer, hats must be doffed to Lowell Sherman for his Oscar-calibre performance. The slide from charming drunk to dissolute bum is presented warts and all, and a late scene in which the director examines his drink-ravaged face in the mirror is powerful indeed. It's hard to imagine what it must have been like for Sherman to play such a role and it was, in fact, one of the last roles he took for the screen, before concentrating on directing--then dying two years later of pneumonia.When David O. Selznick made ""A Star is Born"" for United Artists five years later, four years after leaving RKO, the RKO lawyers prepared a point-by-point comparison of the stories, recommending a plagiarism suit--which was never filed. The later movie never credited Adela Rogers St John or any of the source material of ""What Price Hollywood?"" for its own screenplay, which was written by Dorothy Parker from, supposedly, an idea of Selznick's.""What Price Hollywood?"" is a great source for behind-the-scenes tidbits--Cukor fills the screen with images of on-set action (or inaction), with various crew waiting about as they watch the film-in-a-film action being filmed.

Constance Bennett is lovely and Lowell Sherman is excellent as the alcoholic director, and the behind-the-scenes glimpses of Hollywood studio life were very interesting.

In 1932 critics were congratulating her on her best performance in years in ""Lady With a Past"" and then she was offered the role of Mary Evans in the movie which would cement her reputation for all time - ""What Price Hollywood?"".Originally entitled ""The Truth About Hollywood"" and planned by Selznick as a ""sensational comeback"" film for Clara Bow, Adela Rogers St. John wrote the script but on visiting Clara, she told Selznick that she was too contented with married life to bother returning to films, so Constance was offered the part (Clara would have been fantastic in it). Another film dealing with the ""real"" Hollywood (about the influx of vocal coaches and teachers when movies first began to talk) ""Once in a Lifetime"" was released the same year but was not so well received.Mary Evans (Bennett), a waitress at the Brown Derby, dreams of going into the movies (the opening scene where she uses all the products the movie stars swear by and swoons over Clark Gable is one of the best). She is given plenty of encouragement by the patrons and she finally gets a lucky break when one of her customers, alcoholic director Max Carey (Lowell Sherman) takes her to a movie premiere. As a special favour for looking after him when he passes out, she is given a screen test - ""hibuddyyouhaven't proposedtomeyettonight""!!! and she is terrible but, in another excellent scene, she goes home and rehearses her lines until she is perfect, and a star is born - America's Pal!!!She meets and marries high society polo player, Lonnie Borden (handsome Neil Hamilton) but their wedding turns into a Hollywood circus with zealous fans tearing her gown and veil. Mary doesn't know Lonnie particularly well but soon realises that he wants her to become refined and cultured and is also uncomfortable around her movie friends who he considers crass and vulgar.

Nonetheless, that glimpse of Hollywood exotica comes, I expect, from writer Rowland Brown whose Blood Money (1933) was an extended excursion into pre-Code gender-bending. The movie is well acted and smoothly done, but I wish it had more of that adventurous spirit. It's really a pretty tame depiction of Hollywood life-styles. After all, how surprising is it that the fast track drives some folks to drink. Sherman is excellent in the role, but surprisingly we're never shown why he drinks. Specifically, what is it about the industry that prompts his string of drunken sarcasms. We get the effects, but not the causes. Similarly, how surprising is it that the fast track puts strains on a marriage. Nosy gossip-mongers and late night work hours are understandable strains, but hardly peculiar to Hollywood marriages, though the scale here is admittedly much larger. My point is that the movie works well as an entertaining melodrama, especially as a behind- the-scenes look at a sound stage. However, it's hardly an expose of the type implied in the title—note how kindly paternal the studio head (Ratoff) is portrayed, contrary to the hard- nosed industry reputation. I guess I was expecting something more daring from this pre- Code period, and an ending that didn't suggest the smarmy requirements of the 1950's.

What holds it up after all these years are a strong and realistic performance by Lowell Sherman as a successful Hollywood film director whose alcoholism is destroying his career, decent and sometimes brilliant work by ever-stylish Constance Bennett as the ambitious waitress who becomes an overnight star, beautiful and poetic montages by Slavko Vorkapich, a generally witty and clever script by a team of about eight writers including Adela Rogers St. John and Gene Fowler, and some beautifully directed intimate scenes including the opening in which Bennett dresses for work, copying the beauty tips advertised in the fan magazine she is reading. Highlights: the screen test in which Bennett repeatedly fails to gracefully descend a staircase, deliver one line and then react to the sight of a dead body outside camera range; the filming of a nightclub scene in which Bennett delivers a love song in French (a la Dietrich in MOROCCO) as she strolls among the seated patrons. When you think about it, Bennett is really too sophisticated and worldly for this part, which is why it worked much better for the homespun Janet Gaynor five years later. It really doesn't make sense that a lady who can handle herself with complete ease after being dragged to a movie premiere and unexpectedly shoved in front of a microphone would suddenly turn into a klutz in front of a movie camera in a studio screen test. At one point Bennett is seen to converse in flawless, fluent French and we can only wonder how a lowly waitress with naïve dreams of movie stardom ever got that kind of linguistic education. The only explanation could be that the casting of Bennett required compromises. In any case, her natural charm carries her through.At times the story drags. Neil Hamilton as the stuffed shirt husband adds to the dead weight. The sound quality in the outdoor scenes is weak and tinny. Gregory Ratoff as a studio chieftain has fun but his accent is a bit too thick given the limitations of the recording techniques of the time. Louise Beavers, as always, enlivens her small role as Bennett's maid.",7,8,False
tt0023686,Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman Are Superb,,"Pre-Code insider's look at Hollywood, a precursor to all those STAR IS BORN films.Constance Bennett is a waitress at Hollywood's famed Brown Derby restaurant specifically for the chance of meeting the right contact to help her break into films. In walks Lowell Sherman, a tipsy but famous director. They take a shine to each other and he wakes up the next morning to find her asleep on his living room couch. He invites her to test for a small part in a film, but she's terrible.She works all night on her little scene and finally gets it right. Of course she makes a hit and becomes a big star. She's never romantically involved with Sherman, who's more interested in the bottle. She has everything she ever wanted and marries a stuffy rich boy (Neil Hamilton) who never fits in.Eventually Bennett loses the husband and also loses Sherman as his career slips away because of his drinking. The years go by. One night she gets a call to come get Sherman out of jail where he's been locked up for be drunk and for skipping out on a bar bill. She takes him home and cleans him up, but it's too late.Hard-hitting story stunned a lot of viewers who wanted to believe that the lives of the Hollywood stars was a bed of roses. Bennett and Sherman are superb. Hamilton is fine as the rich husband. Also good are Gregory Ratoff as the producer and Louise Beavers as the devoted maid.There were insider Hollywood stories before this. Marion Davies' comedy SHOW PEOPLE showed how fame can go to an actress' head. The following STAR IS BORN films borrowed heavily from this one but the heroines in these (Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and the 2018 version) were all married to the tragic figure.Perhaps a bigger studio than RKO could have secured the Oscar nominations Lowell Sherman and Constance Bennett deserved for this film.",6,7,False

So much is similar--too much is similar for it to be a coincidence.The film begins with Constance Bennett working as a waitress at the Brown Derby restaurant (it's really cool seeing this building). One of the customers is a drunken director (Lowell Sherman). Sherman is a very happy drunk and gets Bennett to quit her job and go to a big Hollywood premier with him. From this strange meeting, the two eventually go on to make great movies together. However, now that Bennett is a star, life for her is tough. While she is very successful, her private life is practically non-existent and a brief failed marriage proves this. At the same time, Sherman falls deeper and deeper into alcoholism until he is living on the street and Bennett spends much of her time trying to locate and then rehabilitate him. There is much, much more to the story, but I don't want to spoil it by saying more.Overall, a fascinating story that is very watchable. However, it's not as good as ""A Star is Born""--mostly because the ending seems a bit of a letdown. A very good film--one of Bennett's best.",5,7,True
tt0023686,"Constance Bennett does comedy, romance, tragedy, and metacinema",9.0,"An excellent specimen of the subgenre of movies about movie-making, featuring the spectacular Constance Bennett as Marie Evans, a waitress discovered at the Brown Derby by an endearingly inebriated genius director, Max Carey (Lowell Sherman). Actually, she does most of the work in the discovery scene, and he plays along. Not that she does anything wrongshe is just herself. She fails miserably at her first screen test, but spends the night walking through the bit and performs it flawlessly the next morning and becomes a star, taken on by the jovial heavily-accented producer Julius Saxe (Gregory Ratoff). She marries a rich, handsome polo player (Neil Hamilton), who gets tired of Hollywood and leaves. Max's drinking worsens, and he winds up committing suicide in Mary's living room, which destroys her career. She retreats to France, but soon she's reunited with her husband and her career promises to renew itself. This plot is familiartraces of the later A Star is Born and even Dinner at Eight, both of which feature drunks whose careers disappear. Other familiar themes are the rise of a star out of nowhere, the self-absorption of Hollywood, the price paid by stars, and the viciousness of the press. Sherman's early scenes are exceedingly amusing; he manages to make tipsiness seem to be a sort of whimsically inspired state. There's a lot for Bennett to doscrewball comedy at first, then bits of acting of all sorts, even singing in French, romance, tragedyand a lot of scenes of details of the making of films.

tt0023686,The director made her a star...Can she save him from the direction he's going in?,8.0,"Director/Actor Lowell Sherman was a major star in the early 1930's, but yet he is mostly forgotten today, perhaps because he appears to be a ""poor man's John Barrymore"". That being said (and the fact that research I did on him revealed he was a close friend of ""The Great Profile's""), Sherman on his own has a presence that cannot be denied. Not as handsome as Barrymore in his heyday as he was slightly overweight and sometimes more bombastic in his performances as a usually aging Lothario, Sherman seems like an actor whose career was guided by his ego rather than reality. In the case of ""What Price Hollywood?"", however, he gives his best performance, and is certainly comparable to Fredric March and James Mason in the film's two unofficial (and much better well known) remakes.George Cukor, directing Barrymore and Katharine Hepburn the very same year in the outstanding ""A Bill of Divorcement"", is at the helm here, and just like he would later do with the Judy Garland/James Mason 1954 version of ""A Star is Born"", the focus is on the emotions charged up by the relationship of the star who is born (in this case the beautiful Constance Bennett) and the man who discovers her (Sherman) and makes her a big star after simply spotting her on the set of one of his films. He's not the leading man like Norman Maine was; He's the director, having enjoyed the Hollywood spotlight a bit too much, and now suffering from obvious alcohol problems. Unlike Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester and Norman Maine, Bennett and Sherman do not end up in a romantic relationship, but are simply colleagues whose admiration goes beyond a working relationship. So when she becomes a huge star and his reputation at the studio begins to suffer, it is up to her to save him from himself, but at what price? The romantic lead here is Neil Hamilton, later Commissioner Gordon on ""Batman"", who loves Bennett but isn't willing to simply be known as the husband of a star. He wants a real marriage with her but is aghast at the absurdities of the publicity machine, especially a rather obnoxious Hedda/Louella like gossip columnist (a very amusing Josephine Whittell) whom Hamilton puts down much to Bennett's dismay. He's also greatly offended by Sherman's constant infiltration into their lives and this causes a great deal of tension in the marriage. Sherman really shows the dangers of extreme drunkenness, especially when he threatens to set their house on fire. It's up to Bennett to step in, now alone, and try to sober him up for good, even though she knows he's through in Hollywood. A shocking twist has her fighting to save her career, and Bennett must rise above her pride and sudden success to figure out what the important things to her really are.Unique enough to stand out on its own, this is still considered by film historians the first unofficial version of ""A Star is Born"", and it ranks as truly powerful drama. Why it isn't more well known is quite a mystery in itself, especially since the film parallels some real-life scandals which took place the same year of its release. Gregory Ratoff plays the studio head who is devoted to both director and star but is in a powerless position to help them after some bad publicity. Louise Beavers is amusing as Bennett and Hamilton's maid. If the screenplay based upon Adela Rogers St. John hadn't been so well written, this might have dwindled down into sappy melodrama, but thanks to the superb writing and outstanding performances, this ranks as one of the top films of the pre-code era and a true Hollywood story that ""E"" has told over and over again many times.",6,6,True
tt0023686,He Made Her A Star,7.0,"One of George Cukor's earliest successes before his glory years at MGM was this classic What Price Hollywood. Done at RKO it's the story of three star crossed people and that's literal for one of them.Constance Bennett plays Mary Evans who is discovered by drunken director Lowell Sherman while working as a waitress at the famous Brown Derby in Hollywood. In 1932 that was the place to be if one wanted to be discovered because all the Hollywood celebrities dined there at one time or another. Including those like Sherman who liked their cuisine strictly liquid and at that time illegal.You might think that playing a movie star was no stretch for Connie Bennett. But she and her sisters Joan and Barbara were of a distinguished theatrical family with father Richard Bennett in Hollywood himself at that time. She was as far removed from Mary Evans in real life as you can get, still Bennett got deep inside the part.Sherman might have modeled his character on any number of distinguished Hollywood lushes. He probably took bits from all of them, but his director is uniquely his own, at once self centered, talented, vain and frail.The third part of this triangle is Neil Hamilton, polo playing scion of a prominent society family who is introduced to Bennett when he smacks her with a polo ball. It was definitely love at first sight, but love between them takes a rocky road.Hollywood has never been easy on itself. The movie industry figures that the scandals they've had are all too public so honesty is probably the best policy. In the sound era What Price Hollywood is one of the first of a long line of critical examination of the movie industry that also includes The Big Knife, The Bad And The Beautiful, Callaway Went Thataway and Two Weeks In Another Town. And of course we can't forget A Star Is Born in its original and remakes.What Price Hollywood got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. As its done before the Code, it holds up well today as a mark of distinguished and mature film making.",6,6,False
tt0023686,A Star Is Born by Queer Direction,6.0,"Although there had already been many films made about Hollywood and filmmaking by 1932 (Behind the Screen (1916), ""The Extra Girl"" (1923), ""Ella Cinders"" (1926), ""Show People"" (1928) and ""Free and Easy"" (1930), to name a few), ""What Price Hollywood?"" is sometimes considered the first of a particularly-persistent formula retitled ""A Star Is Born"" in subsequent editions, or remakes. Hollywood, alone, has made four versions since and thus far (there are, at least, also two from Bollywood). These pictures feature two stars, one of who is an alcoholic with his career in decline while the ingénue he discovers begins to reach the pinnacle of her career. The main intrigue of these meta narratives, as I see it, is in how these lead characters reflect the real-life images of the stars portraying them.In the 1937 film, the career of Janet Gaynor, the first Best-Actress-Oscar winner, was actually in decline, which if anything was more reflective of the alcoholic part played by Fredric March, whose own Hollywood stardom was, in reality, more recent and would continue to thrive long after Gaynor retired. This dynamic is even more stark in the 1954 remake, where Judy Garland nominally plays the ingénue, but James Mason's addict and unreliable performer may be read as the shadow of Judy's real-life image. The 1976 and 2018 pictures are largely vanity projects of their stars: Barbra Streisand and Bradley Cooper, respectively. And, that's largely reflected on screen, too, as the real-life stars demonstrate their love for their own images. The 2018 one is, perhaps, only saved by its reflexive commentary on Lady Gaga's past in the shallow business of pop music. ""What Price Hollywood?,"" however, casts a couple relatively minor actors in the leads. The resonance of the picture indubitably would've been enhanced had producer David O. Selznick cast his first choice of Clara Bow, or had, say, John Barrymore played the drunkard. Nevertheless, there's one talent involved here whose career may be hinted at in the mirror of this movie, and that's its director, George Cukor, who went on to helm the 1954 version, as well.Interestingly, unlike the subsequent iterations, the aging drunk here is a film director instead of a performer (whether an actor or singer). He also doesn't have a romance with the star he discovers, nor with anyone else on screen, for that matter. Like the boozing director within the film, Cukor, too, was living something of a double life as a homosexual in a then very homophobic society. (Indeed, a biography of Cukor is entitled ""A Double Life,"" which is also the title of another Cukor film about acting.) These two lives surely often clashed; for one, Clark Gable (who's referenced a couple times in this film, which may seem ironic in retrospect), reportedly, had Cukor fired from the set of ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) over the director's sexuality. Also reflecting the protégé part, ""What Price Hollywood?"" was early in Cukor's career and so represented a big break (I mean, his last job involved him being demoted on the set of ""One Hour With You"" (1932), although that was supposedly for reasons of incompetence). This is before he was known as a ""woman's director,"" leading several actresses to Academy Awards and nominations, and would be nominated himself for five Oscars, winning one.""What Price Hollywood?"" would heartily be recommended on the basis of this dynamic between the fading star-director and the rising star-actress, but, unfortunately, the picture is saddled by a dull romance and a bizarrely unfunny series of meet-cute situations. Allegedly, the focus on the romance here was insisted upon by Selznick against the objections of Cukor, who wisely wanted to concentrate on the relationship between the director and actress. This is pre-screwball, and the supposedly-witty banter doesn't work especially well in general, but it gets much worse during the courtship scenes. To land herself a millionaire, waitress-turned-actress Mary Evans contrives to act obnoxiously in front of said millionaire (and polo player--seemingly to make sure I don't care for him right off the bat) Lonny Borden. Things get worse from there, as Mary stands Lonny up for an expensive dinner date she had him plan for her. Next, Lonny brakes into Mary's bedroom (he literally breaks the glass of her door to get in) and kidnaps her, so as to take her to that dinner. Then, he force feeds her! A reasonable viewer might consider this sort of behavior sociopathic and, in Lonny's case, at least, potentially criminal. Compare this to the non-romantic first meeting between Mary and ""big-time"" director Max Carey, which is actually cute and amusing. Additionally, the humor involving African-American, and one French, servants is dated.When the narrative focuses on Hollywood and filmmaking, it's quite good. As opposed to the ""natural"" stars of subsequent versions, we see Mary here needing to practice acting after she blows her first audition. Indeed, she was only a waitress whose only evident training in acting consisted of her practicing in front of a mirror the looks of stars she sees in fan magazines and of imitating the accent of either Marlene Dietrich or Greta Garbo (point is, she's not very good at it--although, later, she more-obviously imitates the singing of Dietrich for a scene in one of Max and Mary's films). These early shots of Mary practicing her reflection stand in contrast to later scenes where Carey looks in the mirror and has nightmarish flashes (there's also an interesting newspaper montage with symbolic, dreamlike imagery). Additionally, during the backstage filmmaking scenes, there are frequent shots focusing on the crew, which is something less seen in the later star-driven versions of ""A Star Is Born,"" where the focus is almost exclusively on the leads.Although ""What Price Hollywood?"" is an odd mix of melodrama and a flat comedy of remarriage, the friendship between Carey and Mary sustains the picture. It also adds heft to Selznick's otherwise rosy picture of Hollywood, with a scenario that holds most of its ire for the press. Carey never makes a pass at her, the would-be ""America's Pal."" As the oddly-accented producer tells Mary at one point, ""The public don't understand relations like between you and Carey."" It's no wonder that the best version of ""A Star Is Born"" would be when Cukor directed Garland, who had already become a tragic figure and gay icon by 1954.",3,5,False

tt0023686,A Star is Born,,"What Price Hollywood? (1932) *** (out of 4)This film is best remembered for influencing A Star is Born but it stands on its own pretty well. Constance Bennett plays a waitress working at The Brown Derby who gets a break when she meets a hot director (Lowell Sherman). The director puts her in the pictures, her fame goes up but things start to change after her marriage. All of this is surrounded by the director's need for alcohol. As you can tell, the future Fredric March film contains pretty much the same story but the biggest difference here is that we get some nice pre-code moments. I guess mistreating women was a big thing after The Public Enemy was released a year earlier because there's an really bizarre sequence where Neil Hamilton breaks into the bedroom of Bennett, carries her off and then forces food down her mouth. Bennett gets to wear some pretty sexy outfits as well but it's her performance that works. She's extremely good in her early scenes as the waitress tries to break into Hollywood. We get to see her first audition, which she messed up very badly, and you can't help but think the actress is just reliving experiences. Sherman steals the film as the drunken director who really gets to shine in terms of drama and comedy. Of course being 1932 most of the alcoholism is played for laughs. The film's biggest problem is that the middle half turns into pure melodrama, which really ruins all the satire and spoof of the opening segments. When Bennett and Hamilton are married we have to sit through countless scenes of them fighting and these scenes are rather tiresome as they don't offer anything we've haven't seen countless times.",3,4,False

She is Kay Francis, the best dressed woman of the 30's. They are both very attractive, yet doomed.Such is the basic storyline for this wonderful drama filled with tears, humor, and drama. The team of Powell and Francis had appeared together in four films at Paramount before being signed by Warner Brothers in 1932 when they made this film along with another classic, ""Jewel Robbery"". Where Powell and his later partner Myrna Loy exemplified sophisticated humor several years later at MGM, Powell and Francis were a romantic couple. Both Loy and Francis were well-dressed, dark-haired beauties. While Loy had a career that lasted almost 60 years, Francis would retire from the screen by the mid-late 40's. As a result, she was one of Hollywood's forgotten leading ladies until the success of Ted Turner's classic movie channel brought her back into the limelight.""One Way Passage"" is the team's most beloved film, and its Academy Award winning story is just one of the highlights. The stars are another, but the supporting cast was simply superb as well. Frank McHugh, as a drunken conman, is perfect comedy relief along with the fabulous Aline MacMahon as the phony ""countess"". If there had been Supporting Academy Awards for acting in 1932, she would have won for this film handsdown. She is simply wonderful. There is not a moment of hers on screen where she doesn't dominate it. Warner Brothers apparently offered her the chance to become a leading lady, but the realistic MacMahon realized that her best parts would come with the character roles that often stole the limelight away from the stars. Catch MacMahon in the very well known ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" and more obscure films such as ""The Merry Frinks"" and ""While the Patient Slept"" to see what I mean. Her later films, ""Dragon Seed"" and ""The Search"", are perfect examples of what a gem she was as a performer.The music score, later heard in the background of many a Warners ""B"" film, is classic. The screenplay is superb, and the length-well, a mere 68 minutes, which goes to show that good things do come in small packages. Sadly, after this and ""Jewel Robbery"", Powell and Francis were never paired again; Powell went onto MGM where better things awaited him, while Francis remained at Warners for many similar films, none of which could surpass the charm of this film.

Only this movie is not a screwball comedy or a story about rich people in tuxedos chitchatting when they are not dancing. Writer Robert Lord's frequent writing partner in 1932 and 1933, Wilson Mizner, specialized in stories about people on the margins of society, peaking with the great Heroes For Sale. In one way or another, most of the characters in One Way Passage are nearing the end of their line. When Frank McHugh's character Skippy drinks alone at a bar in Agua Caliente on New Year's Eve, there is no longer the usual smile on his face as he stares at his drink.

But judging movies by how they stand the test of time, movies released in 1932 and 1933 stand up better. One Way Passage is proof of that.

""Barrel House"" Betty is passing herself as the phony Countess Barilhaus, and a man from Dan's past, Skippy, is also finding ways to scam passengers. In this setting, Joan falls in love with Dan. She has no idea about his past, or why he is on this particular ship. Dan, on the other hand, has no inkling about the fatal disease Joan is suffering. Their time together is precious and both fall hopelessly in love. Skippy and the Countess plot together to help Dan escape. Their scheme involves the phony countess falling in love with Dr. Hymer, who is attending Joan on this trip. Dan has decided to try to escape, and as they arrive in San Francisco, where Joan learns the truth about Dan and collapses. Dan never goes ahead with his plan and is sent away.This bittersweet story of an impossible romance, was given a wonderful treatment by Tay Garmett, a director who knew how to stage these impossible romances. Robert Lord created a fine screen play that even seen today makes a lot sense.William Powell and Kay Francis play the doomed lovers. Mr. Powell, one of the handsomest figures of the time is the right man for the exquisite Kay Francis, who was one of the most popular leading ladies at Warner. Before the arrival on the scene of Bette Davis, Ms. Francis reigned supreme because of her intriguing beauty and her way of making every character she played a winner. The joy of this film though are Aline MacMahon and Frank McHugh. These two character actors give their best to make this a winning comedy.""One Way Passage"" is a movie that will not disappoint the lovers of classical cinema.",32,36,True
tt0023305,A great example of William Powell's acting range,,"The more I see of William Powell, the more impressed I am with him. Because he did a lot of light parts and is mostly known these days for the Thin Man movies, his reputation has suffered. He is a remarkably subtle actor, more so than many others in the early 30's, a transitional period as talkies wiped out silents and acting styles were in flux. His Thin Man movies, though fun, don't do him justice. I think his best acting is in earlier films like this one and MANHATTAN MELODRAMA.William Powell plays a captured crook heading for execution at San Quentin. Kay Francis is a dying woman he meets in a bar in Hong Kong; they wind up together on a ship for San Francisco. The plot centers around their shipboard romance and how they try to keep their respective ""terminal"" conditions secret from each other. For a 1932 movie, it's quite modern in feel--lots of nice (but not grandiose) stylistic touches, like some sweeping camera movements, especially the ones along a bar that open and close the movie. Considering there is only one plotline, the supporting cast really gets a chance to shine; Aline McMahon plays somewhat against type as a con artist traveling as a duchess, and Frank McHugh is another crook who pulls con jobs while acting perpetually drunk. They team up to help Powell outsmart the cop who has him under lock and key (Warren Hymer). The character of the cop is interesting--he eventually is seen in a fairly favorable light, despite his antagonism toward Powell.  I'm not a big Kay Francis fan, but she's adequate here.",29,35,False

Powell's character avoids getting caught by police agents on the ship. At the same time he romances Francis. The interplay between Powell, Francis & even the rest of the cast is great.

I instantly put ""One Way Passage"" on my list. I wasn't surprised when it wasn't on anyone else's list, this is an obscure gem. The balance of melodrama and comedy is perfect; as it is in many thirties Warner Bros. dramas. It seems strange at first, but think it through. (For example, my ux Tom posits that Warners's unusual lug-n-mug filled western, ""The Oklahoma Kid"" is probably accurate, as most of the folks in the historical wild, woolly west moved from the wild East and could have talked like Cagney.) The McHugh and MacMahon sub-plots are are not just comic relief from the romance, they are deftly integrated into it, and they become romantic co-conspirators. This adds to the appeal; the descriptions ""chick flick,"" ""weeper,"" ""women's picture"" can not apply. The leads are sexy, gorgeous, and lovable. The crossed cigarettes tossed on the beach shows how the restraints on old movies resulted in delicious images. The crossed, broken cocktail glass image, at first seen quite early on in the movie, makes me question why IMDb Comments posters are saying this is movie has an unhappy ending (that's not a spoiler, is it?)",23,30,False
tt0023305,Watch this one and skip the remake.,8.0,"In the 1930s, Hollywood remade pictures at an astounding rate. Often, only three to five years after the original film was made, the same studio would remake the film--and rarely were the two versions that different--just the cast. Now if the original film were somehow seriously flawed and the remake corrected that, I could understand, but too often, like the saying goes, ""when you've seen one, you've seen them all"". In the case of ""One Way Passage"", eight years later the film was remade with George Brent and Merle Oberon (""'Til We Meet Again (1940)""). While Brent and Oberon were fine actors and they gave it their best, the bottom line is that the original is pretty much the same film...only better.In this film, William Powell plays a man wanted for murder who has been hopping the world trying to avoid the law. The film begins with him finally being caught by a nice but somewhat dim-witted detective (Warren Hymer--who made a career out of playing slow-witted guys). So, he books passage for them both to return from the Orient to America so Powell can serve his sentence--the death penalty! On board the ship, Powell is attracted to lovely Kay Francis. She does not know he's a condemned man, nor does he know that she's dying from a ""Hollywood Disease""--a fatal illness that has very few symptoms, keeps you looking great and usually is unnamed! Both fall in love and spend all their time together--even though their love is fated to end before its time. There's quite a bit more to it than this, but I don't want to spoil the film, so I'll say no more about the plot.The bottom line is that the film is original and extremely artistic. The music and soft cinematography work wonderfully together to make a very sad but romantic film. The only negatives are the impossibility of the story--if you think about it, it really doesn't seem possible.

tt0023305,A Doomed Romance,8.0,"In between his time with Paramount and MGM, William Powell did a two year stint at Warner Brothers where I don't think Jack and his brothers ever quite knew what to do with him. His films there, vary in quality, but the best of them is this doomed romance with Kay Francis, One Way Passage. The title itself tells how poignant this film will be.Powell is a fugitive who is tracked down and brought aboard ship in handcuffs by San Francisco Detective Warren Hymer. Powell escaped while being transported to San Quentin to be hung for murder. At the same time good time party girl Kay Francis is traveling home essentially to die. Unsaid at the time because the audience knew what the effects of bootleg liquor were on some people from the Roaring Twenties. Her organs are generally failing and she's coming home to die.These two people are as poignant a pair of lovers as has ever been brought to the screen. Neither knows about the other and the aura of heartbreak just permeates One Way Passage. It's a cosmic joke played on them, both finding in each other a reason to live and both knowing it can't be.Warren Hymer plays it a great deal straighter than he normally does. He's not the brightest cop in the world, but he's a far from the dim witted hooligans he usually is cast. Aline McMahon and Frank McHugh are a pair of confidence workers who both team up to help the doomed Powell and Francis. McHugh repeated his own role in the remake of One Way Passage from 1940, Till We Meet Again.The most cynical heart will melt in seeing One Way Passage.",20,24,False
tt0023305,Two doomed people fall in love,8.0,"Kay Francis and William Powell are doomed lovers in ""One Way Passage,"" a 1932 film also starring Frank McHugh, Aline McMahan and Warren Hymer. Right after meeting the lovely Joan Ames in a bar, escaped murderer Dan Hardesty is caught by Sgt. Steve Burke and brought back to San Francisco via ship to be hanged. Ames is also on board ship; she's dying of an incurable illness (probably some form of heart disease they couldn't do anything about in 1932). Knowing the sergeant can't swim, Hardesty, handcuffed to him, jumps overboard and, while trying to drown Burke, steals the handcuff key and frees himself. When Burke yells for help, it draws attention from passengers, and Hardesty has no choice but to save him. To thank him for saving his life, Burke lets Hardesty walk around the ship with no handcuffs. Thus, when he and Joan meet again, she has no idea he's headed for a death sentence, and he doesn't know about her.I saw Carol Burnett do a send-up of either this or the remake - just think if Burnett were on TV today, no one would have any idea what she was doing. How times have changed.This is a beautiful film with wonderful performances, not only from Powell and Francis, but from Frank McHugh, Aline McMahon, and Warren Hymer. McHugh is a petty crook who runs into McMahon, another crook who is posing as a countess. She catches the eye of Sgt. Burke. It's a great subplot with some fun moments.Powell is gallant, melancholy, and charming, and Francis is glamorous and lovely; both give very touching and sweet performances, each knowing he/she isn't going to live. Each time they drink together, they break their glasses and cross the stems, and this crossing is something the camera focuses on as they sit in a cove in Hawaii and toss away their cigarettes. The ending is one of the best ever and will make the viewer smile and cry at the same time.It's 1932, so some of the sound seems to have been done in an echo chamber, but that shouldn't bother anyone.

She doesn't know he's been grabbed by cop Warren Hymer, and is going to be hanged at San Quentin as soon as he gets off the boat.It's so intensely, romantically heartbreaking that my usual reaction would be to roll my eyes, but in the hands of director Tay Garnett, it simply overwhelms me. Cinematographer Robert Kurrie's lighting is made for Miss Francis, and William Powell's simple, declaratory line readings give the dialogue, which never gets flowery, a passion too intense to bear unmoved.Among the supporting players, Aline MacMahon as a confidence woman who falls for Hymer, stands out; she never met a script or cast she could not steal. What's remarkable is the way their interaction humanizes Hymer, in one of his roles that looks like one of his standard, ridiculous mugs. The bartenders that feed them cocktails and witness their passion -- Glen Cavender, Mike Donlin, Roscoe Karns, and William Halligan -- offer visual comments, as do the trail of discarded cigarettes and broken cocktail glasses, each lying in broken, satiated pairs.As I said, I want to roll my eyes.

tt0023305,Hard to swallow,5.0,"The only reason I'm reviewing this film is because I find its score hard to swallow. There is nothing here that merits such a high one and I'm a fan of both Kay Francis and William Powell. They have given much better performances elsewhere. ""Jewel Robbery"" for instance, where they both appear, is much more fun and considerably more realistic. Here everything seems forced. They are good but they lack chemistry. And the supporting cast also doesn't click. Aline McMahon is hard to take as an adventuress on the hunt for a sugar daddy who falls for the dumb cop played by Wayne Hymer whose character is totally lacking in any social graces. You're left wondering why on earth she would be attracted to this bozo. And then there's Frank McHugh who plays a drunk throughout the movie and managed to just annoy me. So there you have it. On a positive note the film begins auspiciously with the bar scene where our protagonists first meet. There is a marvelous little vignette of the a capella trio as they struggle to catch the gratuities tossed to them by customers. It's fun as is the actual meeting scene of Francis and Powell but after that auspicious beginning the film deteriorates rapidly.",7,21,False
tt0023305,a bit of a split personality,6.0,"this is not the great cinema, ethereal experience or most romantic movie of all time - despite several reviewers insistence. it is early Powell, and while he is always watchable and just grabs you with his first look, he hasn't quite got the assurance he showed in the thin man a couple of years later. i can't quite specify, but he seems just a little off. Kay Francis plays her part very nicely, and she and Powell go well together. McMahon, as the countess is good; not a demanding roll, but deftly handled. from here on out the cast gets a bit sketchy.McHugh overplays his part terribly and does it in dumb staggering-drunk fashion. the second time, third if you are a very forgiving person, he lets out with his breathless idiot's laugh you want to strangle him. this part could have been something; it's the chance to steal scenes from the stars. it is one of those little parts that can offer a lot to a fine actor. McHugh, in this role anyway, is not that actor. the routine would have gone over well in a 3 stooges film.Hymer, as Steve Burke, was a disappointment, too. the figure is cut from cardboard: dumb cop, easily duped, but maybe has redeeming characteristics. he's too dumb here. there is no reason he couldn't have been smart. his portrayal really offers Powell nothing to play against. as for his redeeming characteristics, well, they didn't show me enough to explain why a smart dame like countess Betty would want to hitch her wagon to his star forever. it doesn't play.oh. lest i forget, catch the bartender in the Brit pub in h.k.in the opening scenes. he has to be Sam Shepard's grandpa. his few seconds of fame is well spent.i imagine all the actors were really quite competent. the writers let them down, i think. could have been much better.",7,21,True
tt0023305,Hide the Baccarat! Powell and Francis are coming over for drinks!,,"In a classic demonstration that good things come in small packages, this film (clocking in at just under 70 minutes) has a terrific cast enacting a wildly romantic, yet fun and stylish story. Powell plays a slick, somewhat shady type who has committed a murder, though the victim was apparently someone who deeply deserved to get it. He is picked up in Hong Kong by Hymer, who vows to take him to San Francisco (namely to San Quentin) to be hanged for his crime. Boarding a cruise liner, Powell attempts to escape and nearly drowns Hymer in the process. When he saves Hymer's life, Hymer allows him to roam the ship freely once they've set out. Powell runs into glamorous and charming socialite Francis and the two strike up a tentative romance. They enjoy a memorable, if messy, penchant for smashing their glasses after each drink and crossing the stems on the bar. Unfortunately, she's in very poor health and isn't supposed to experience any shocks or touch any alcohol. Her verve where Powell is concerned, however, causes her to cast away any safeguards and live her remaining life to its fullest. Also on board are McHugh as a con man who's always got an angle and MacMahon as a con woman who's posing as a wealthy countess in order to bilk a fellow passenger out of some dough. These two play a part in aiding the romance of Powell and Francis when Hymer begins to tighten Powell's leash. Eventually, the ship docks in San Francisco and the lovers discover each other's secret, while not realizing that the other one knows it. Thus, a classic tear-jerking set-up is achieved, topped off by an epilogue that suggests that perhaps even death can't truly separate these two. Powell is solid and assured in his role, veering comfortably between humor and pathos as needed. Francis, a major star of the 30's who is all but forgotten today, is as vigorous and fashionable as she is romantic and tender. They make a memorable couple. Hymer, so often a thick-headed lug as he basically is in this film as well, gives an enjoyably grumpy performance. MacMahon is striking, showing a gift for characterization and an attractive look that may startle those who only know her from her later frowzy parts. McHugh, who was a drinking pal of Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien among other Irish actors stationed in Hollywood, is a delight. His trademark sing-song laugh is utilized often, but remains amusing each time. Hs underrated persona adds a lot to the film. It's a brief, but well-done, jewelry box of a film that runs the gamut from comedy to romance to tragedy very adeptly.",17,18,True
tt0023305,One of my favorite romances,10.0,"Having brought Kay Francis and William Powell over from Paramount in 1932, Warner Brothers reteamed them in a romance that turned out to be as good as anything they did at their former studio.Kay Francis plays Joan, a doomed girl with an unnamed disease on her way to a sanitarium in San Francisco. Her case is fatal, it is just a matter of whether it is months or weeks or days. William Powell plays Dan, an escaped murderer who has been sentenced to hang that is recaptured in Hong Kong by a detective (Warren Hymer) who has the flattest of feet. Hymer usually played dense types, but here he has a head on his shoulders, most of the time. Dan and Joan meet in a bar in Hong Kong, and it is love at first sight.They wind up on the same boat headed back to San Francisco. Dan has convinced the cop to let him wander about the boat freely because he saved the cop from drowning, though he did so reluctantly. Joan sees Dan on the boat and decides she is going to live life to the fullest, even if it shortens her days. Ultimately, both of them wind up losing their lives for the sake of their love for the other. Dan loses a couple of opportunities to escape to help Joan, and Joan shortens her life by not staying in bed during the whole voyage and ultimately dies upon the shock of hearing about Dan's fate and seeing Dan led away in handcuffs as they dock in San Francisco.Now this might seem like a depressing movie, but Warners did lighten it up a bit by sticking in a romance between a con-woman (Aline MacMahon) posing as a Russian countess and the cop who at first sees Dan as a great prize to take back to the states, but by film's end feels very sorry for the guy to the point you can tell he wishes he could just let him go. Frank McHugh rounds things out as a pickpocket.The final scene gets me every time. Dan and Joan, through their entire 24 day voyage, have been lying to each other about their fate and vow to meet in Agua Caliente for New Year's Eve if they can't find each other before. Thus the final scene is a sad McHugh, drinking alone in Agua Caliente as New Year's partying goes on around him. There is a sound of breaking glass. There, with nobody around, are the stems of two broken glasses laying side by side - which was what Joan and Dan did with their glasses when they had their first drink together. The glasses disappear and become as invisible as the lovers, presumably reunited at last in the hereafter.If this doesn't choke you up, check to see if you have a pulse.

tt0023305,Ill-fated shipboard romance is ideal for Kay Francis...,6.0,"A shipboard tale of doomed lovers, ONE WAY PASSAGE manages to be interesting despite the shaky premise that lovers can meet, fall in love instantly and all the while harboring deep secrets that neither one is willing to reveal. It makes for great cinema if done properly and this version of the weepy tale almost succeeds.The biggest drawback is the need to have comedy relief in the form of FRANK McHUGH, who overplays his role as a drunken thief in cohorts with a confidence woman, ALINE MacMAHON. While MacMahone manages to make her fake Countess a believable enough character, McHugh overplays his sing-song laugh and drunken bits of humor so outrageously that the story falls apart whenever he gets extensive footage.If the tale had been confined to Miss Francis and Powell, director Tay Garnett would have gotten better results. He manages the direction very well, especially for that neat little ending which gives the story the sort of lift you'd never expect.Kay Francis is assured and lovely as the doomed woman enroute to a sanitarium and William Powell is debonair as the man who takes one glance at her and falls deeply in love, but is on his way to San Quentin on a murder charge. WARREN HYMER, as a dumb cop, is another example of the film's penchant for weak comedy relief.All it lacks is a heavy use of violins on the soundtrack to glorify the romance--but it manages to be ""an affair to remember,"" 1930s style, despite some weaknesses.",8,16,False

This situation, though obnoxiously artificial, and a little too breathless, still left me suspended in an afterglow. That there was an unhappy happy ending was something sweet, and in the final measures much less condescending than almost anything of similar flavor.But this had me from the very first scene. Three people are singing in a bar in Hong Kong for tossed coins. One of the coins falls in a spittoon. The guy on the left, nearest the spittoon, quickly judges it a loss. But the guy next to him cannot forget about it. It is one of the fastest dives into the core of a film I can recall.

tt0023305,A romance for the ages,10.0,"I had the great pleasure of rewatching One Way Passage recently. It is a film about love, life, and death with a remarkable ethereal charm. Dan (William Powell) is of the criminal element and under threat of the hangman's noose, but easily forgiven for ""croaking the dirtiest heel that ever lived."" Joan (Kay Francis) is a darling of a socialite with an apparent heart condition that has her days numbered. Together on a month-long crossing from Hong Kong to San Francisco via Honolulu, ""the world and time seem somewhere else,"" she remarks. It blossoms into a sacrificial love of mutual devotion. To help her he forgoes a chance to save his neck, and she taunts death all the while by disobeying her doctor's orders to remain at rest.I love the Golden Age of Hollywood, but not so much for the comedy. One Way Passage is exceptionally funny thanks to Aline MacMahon as Betty, a con artist who masquerades as a countess and Frank McHugh as the thief, Skippy. They are also two of the best friends any film character ever had. I have not seen a better example of honor among thieves. The subplot between Betty and Warren Hymer's sympathetic and honest cop, Steve, is very much welcomed.New Year's Eve in Agua Caliente is a most happy occasion as the film ends.

tt0023305,"""The luck's come back this time in full glasses""",8.0,"I haven't seen 'Love Affair (1939),' but I have seen 'An Affair to Remember (1957),' and that film undoubtedly owed something to Tay Garnett's 'One Way Passage (1932).' In McCarey's film, a trans-Atlantic liner becomes a metaphor for love: two people fall hopelessly for one another, becoming adrift on a vessel of passion that precludes all former relationships or future life plans. When the ship reaches its destination – New York – reality intrudes on emotion, and love is thrown into turmoil. In 'One Way Passage,' the reality is death itself. Joan (Kay Francis) has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and will be lucky to survive the journey to America. Dan (William Powell) has been convicted for murder, and in San Quentin awaits his gallows. Neither knows that the other is walking death row, either figuratively or literally, but love intercedes on their behalf: just as a star is brightest before its extinction, so too is love at its most passionate when the lovers' time is limited. Despite its very brief running time (67 minutes), 'One Way Passage' is one of the great unsung romances. An aura of hope pervades the film. Though the viewer is always aware of the inevitable, I loathe to describe the story as a ""doomed romance."" Such a label would properly refer to, say, Lean's 'Brief Encounter (1945)' or Ophüls' 'Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948),' in which the prevailing mood is that of tragedy and misspent emotion. In 'One Way Passage,' not an ounce of passion goes to waste, each lover fully aware that their time together is brief. I was also struck by the notion that love doesn't necessarily entail complete openness between lovers. Lying, if done to protect rather than deceive, can be the most heartbreakingly romantic thing of all (I'm reminded of the devoted father in 'A Night to Remember (1958)' who, with admirable composure, assures his family that the Titanic will not sink, despite knowing that his own death is unavoidable). Garnett's casual use of long takes in masterful, giving the story a poetic fluidity without drawing attention to itself.William Powell was one of the busiest stars of the 1930s, enjoying the security of, not one, but two recurring characters (Philo Vance and Nick Charles, both detectives). 'One Way Passage' was produced by Warner Brothers before he moved to M-G-M in 1934. Even before 'The Thin Man (1934),' however, Powell was one of the classiest stars in Hollywood, here delivering his dialogue with unsurpassed aplomb. Kay Francis was a new face for me, but her eyes simply sparkle with life and emotion, her character torn between the joys of love and the heartbreak of impending death. Of the supporting players, only Frank McHugh – as a drunken pickpocket with a weaselly cackle – destroyed the mood of the film, his alcoholism far less amusing than Nick Charles' subsequent hankering for martinis. While Aline MacMahon and Warren Hymer are strong, 'One Way Passage' truly belongs to Powell and Francis, and to a love than persists long after its participants have moved on to other worlds.",9,11,False

tt0023305,a quick comparison (SPOILERS),,"I recently saw Edmund Goulding's excellent 40s remake 'TIL WE MEET AGAIN, and then saw this original version of the same story directed by Tay Garnett. They are very close; here are the differences I noticed.1) Both have very stylish opening scenes. This 30s version opens with such a tour-de-force (including a trio of harmony singers with one wonderfully dykey dame), I thought the movie was going to be another display of elaborate camera moves like Garnett's ""Prestige,"" but it settles down after that. Goulding's version gets more quickly to introducing our hero.2) The 40s version is longer, and the extra material comes on the heroine's side of the melodrama, with a gallery of supporting characters who are in on her secret, echoing the hero's supporting cast. In retrospect, this lends balance that the 30s version doesn't have; Garnett focuses more squarely on the man and makes the woman more a part of his story rather than having them cross into each other's lives.3) Some details might have to do with pre-Code films vs. Production Code era. The 30s version doesn't bother to claim our hero is innocent of the murder charge (Frank McHugh only says the rat deserved it!), while I thought the latter version implies he might be (which, interestingly, means there could be a miscarriage of justice--something the Code frowns upon).4) 30s version has misplaced comedy relief in the overplaying of the drunken cohort (played by McHugh in both versions, but in the first version he's constantly emitting high-pitched giggles and falling into mirrors, even though he's supposedly a smooth thief). The 30s cop (Warren Hymer) is made out something of a mug who forever does double-takes at minor witticisms--not exactly convincing us he's the toughest bulldog in Frisco. Pat O'Brien is more convincing in the 40s version, which throws the comedy relief where it does the most good--on Eric Blore as the Countess' chump (a character almost absent from the first version.)5) The cop and the countess: In the 30s version, the Countess gets the bullets out of the cop's gun not by getting him drunk, but with a silent pan to an unmade bed and a tie hanging on a chair, which has a different implication entirely. There's a pre-Code touch! Also, the 30s cop doesn't let on that he finds out about her past, but implies he's quitting the force to marry her, while the later version has him as such a straight arrow that he lectures her on the empty road she's traveling.Both are worth seeing. Overall, I slightly prefer the 40s version; it leaves one with a more complete sense of devastated characters, so the ending (identical in both) packs a punch that's somehow both tough and sappy.",6,11,True

John Barrymore's career started going downhill after the introduction of sound. Lionel Barrymore, wearing one of the phoniest fake beards, tries to capture the charisma and sense of control that Rasputin had over Czarina Alexandra and the Czarevitch.

He was also one of the most enigmatic and contradictory. A holy man who was accused of raping a nun, excessive drinking, and being power hungry. Barrymore's portrayal of Rasputin plays this up, plus making claims that he will be Russia. He seems almost like Charles Manson at times in the way he can make someone, especially the Czarevitch, behave like they are totally different people compared to the way they acted before meeting Rasputin.It is best to watch this movie as just that - a fictional representation of various accounts of what happened in the royal court of Russia in its final days. The writers included Charles MacArthur, Ben Hecht, Robert Sherwood, Mercedes de Acosta, and Lenore Coffee - some of the best writers of the period.It's worth a view - don't expect historical accuracy, but it is an interesting film that tries to show a much different world than what Americans would have known.",37,41,False
tt0023374,A powerful tale of tragedy,9.0,"By now, everyone - but everyone - has commented on what bad history this movie is. Fine, I won't argue the point. But, what about it as drama? In my opinion, this is one of the most powerful tales of tragedy of it's time. ( This is particularly noteworthy given MGM's later penchant for frivolousness. ) Part of it has do do with the sincerity and conviction of the story. [ Alhough Charles MacArtur and others are given credit for the screenplay, I believe the original story - I have read a copy of the book - was written by a Russian émigré who fled the revolution. Unfortunately, I am presently unable to locate my copy. ] Nonetheless, this would go a long way towards explaining the movie's passion. As for the acting; it features an outstanding cast, including the three Barrymores, as well as an assemblage of first rate supporting actors of the time. ( Anyone notice Edwarld Arnold as Dr. Remezov? ) Of course, much of it seems dated by today's standards. ( This was 1932, after all. ) Keep in mind that this is high melodrama. In that context, Lionel Barrymore exudes pure evil as the scheming, mad monk. He also brings out the crudity and vulgarity of the man, which generally jibes with historical accounts. Just try not to dwell on the fake beard. John is fine and properly earnest as Prince Chegodieff, although his performance does seem a bit old-fashioned next to Lionel's. He really lets it all hang out in the murder scene, however. Ethel seems a trifle stiff, but Ralph Morgan is just right as Nicholas. In fact, sincerity and seriousness of purpose seem to be the hallmarks of the entire ensemble. And through it all, there is this sense of tragic inevitability; of events that, once set in motion, cannot be reversed.One other thing that warrants a mention is the music. The Russian Orthodox liturgical music used in the celebratory scene near the beginning is moving and powerful. It could well put one in mind of the the wedding scene in Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" ( 1978 ). Later, there is a medley of martial music, accompanied by historical footage, as Russia mobilizes for The Great War. Here we hear ""God Save the Tsar"", a tune which Mikhail Glinka featured in his opera, ""A Life for the Tsar"", but which was routinely banned during Soviet performances. All in all, exciting stuff. This is a movie well worth watching, historical accuracy notwithstanding.",30,32,False

John Barrymore is great as Prince Paul, the assassin of Rasputin (in real life, it was Prince Yussupov who assassinated Rasputin).This is a good film, but if you want a better interpretation of Rasputin's ""reign,"" rent the 1996 HBO version with Alan Rickman or the 1971 movie, ""Nicholas and Alexandra.""",21,31,False
tt0023374,The Malevolent Monk,5.0,"In Margot Peters excellent book The House of Barrymore she characterized what MGM had to deal with in the only time the three Barrymore siblings were in a film together, John on drink, Lionel on drugs, and Ethel on her high horse. More truth than humor there.John's drinking and self destruction from same are well known. Lionel was on all kinds of pain killing medication which Louis B. Mayer kept him supplied with in return for being the fifth column of management whenever his contract players started getting ideas. For Ethel however this was her first venture into sound films and she was one who took the title of First Lady of the American Theater quite seriously with all the royal prerogatives of same.Somehow this retelling of the last days of the Romanovs did get made and in it Lionel Barrymore who had the most colorful part of the film, takes the acting honors. His Rasputin, the malevolent monk who held sway over the Tsar and Tsarina because of his ability to control the symptoms of the Tsaretch's hemophilia is a classic study in evil. Ethel is properly regal and John is the noble prince who eventually does something about the curse over the Romanovs, though too late.Rasputin was bad enough in history though here the writers went a bit overboard. There's no accusation against him of having designs on the royal princesses, yet we see Lionel casting a lascivious eye on the Princess Anastasia.Though the name was changed for the film, the real assassin of Rasputin, Prince Felix Yousapov did sue MGM and collect a bundle from them. Personally I think he robbed the lion studio because if anything John Barrymore's portrayal was far more noble than Yousapov was in real life. To add insult to injury though another guy with the name of Chegodieff which was John's name in the film also sued MGM and claimed he was defamed and won.The biggest historical error I find though was the fact that Rasputin was urging Tsar Nicholas to enter World War I. In fact the opposite was the case. Speaking of the Tsar, he's played here as the nebbish he was in real life by Ralph Morgan.For reasons I don't understand the film did not end with Rasputin's demise. Dramatically speaking it should have. But the film continued on until the execution of the royal family by the Bolsheviks. No proper dramatic foundation was laid for that event. There is some mention of revolution in the air, but nothing in the story suggests what will take place.Rasputin and the Empress is bad history and mediocre drama.

tt0023374,Great as dramatic history but as for Russian history...,7.0,"...forget about it. This film is completely inaccurate in its portrayal of actual events in Russian history. As for the nature and character of the historical figures involved, the three Barrymores give good renditions. There is Ethel Barrymore looking every inch the empress and giving a convincing portrayal of a woman concerned for the welfare of her very ill son - and I would expect that. What I didn't expect is how weird it would be to watch a film in which John Barrymore is the shining hero and Lionel Barrymore is a truly diabolical villain, and each are spectacularly convincing in their portrayals. Lionel is really the center of attention here as he plays the evil Rasputin whose ability to sidestep assassination attempts is legendary, and here a few logical explanations are given to some of his alleged abilities. However, none can explain what happened at the end of his life - how he was poisoned, bludgeoned, shot, and finally thrown into an icy river and still managed to cling to life for awhile.Although Tsar Nicholas is accurately portrayed as a rather weak willed man and the Romanov marriage is also accurately portrayed as one of the few royal arranged marriages that also turned out to be a love match, there is a mischaracterization of the Tsar as being progressive and wanting a Duma only to have Rasputin defeat that plan. In fact, Nicholas was autocratic in his outlook and distrusted any attempt to give the people more say in their government. This sets up one of the great ironic struggles in the film - that of aristocrat Prince Paul Chegodieff (John Barrymore) wanting more for the peasants in the way of both bread and democracy, and that of peasant mystic Rasputin (Lionel Barrymore) saying that it was God's will that the peasants were poor and powerless. Paul wants to save Russia, Rasputin wants to rule it.Another piece of fiction shown in the movie for dramatic measure are the public proclamations about the illness of Tsaravich Alexai, the heir to the Russian throne. In fact one of the things that turned the Russian people against the royal family - besides the fact that they were starving during WWI - was that the people assumed that Rasputin's hold over the empress was because they were lovers. The Romanovs did not want it to be known that the only son in the family and heir to the throne had a serious disease - in this case hemophilia - that kept him in very delicate health and would likely lead to a greatly shortened lifespan. They felt it would leave them vulnerable to the overthrowing of their rule. Ironically hiding the truth and leaving Rasputin's relationship to the empress unexplained also led to exactly that.Watch this one for the high production values and compelling performances by the members of Hollywood's royal family during its golden age, but as for a Russian history lesson, look elsewhere.",23,24,False

The acting is more than a bit overdone, a carryover perhaps from the silent days when double takes and facial quirks had to tell the story. Rasputin's death is inaccurate. He was probably not poisoned at all (as an ascetic, he did not eat sweets, poisoned or otherwise), and he was shot several times, not hit over the head with a poker. And the deaths of the Romanovs was not outside in a courtyard but in a closed, dingy cellar. Their doctor died with them--he didn't escape to London. However, in defense of the screenwriter, many of the details of the Rasputin/Romanov disaster were unknown until after the fall of the Soviet Union. Several books published since, including photographs of Rasputin's dead body, for example, do much to fill out the real story.",13,23,False

Saving her son, the monk soon finds himself gaining power inside the government but this doesn't sit well with Prince Chegodieff (John) who will stop at nothing to prove the monk is mad. Apparently MGM was sued due to how inaccurate the story is here so if you want a history lesson you should go read a book but if you want to see all three Barrymore's together then this is the only film out there that will suit you. The film should have been a lot better than it is but the thing drags at several points and I'm sure fifteen or so minutes could have been trimmed from the 123-minute running time, although apparently the film ran longer when originally released. The performances aren't what you'd expect but it's certainly fun seeing the three Barrymore's working together. Lionel actually goes way over the top, which is something you'd expect from John but he actually manages to be quite calm and cool throughout the film. John certainly gives the best performance but it's Lionel who steals the film with his fake beard and over the top antics. Ethel is good in her role as is the supporting work from Ralph Morgan.

And it is great to see John Barrymore in a good role even a romantic role before his drinking made him a caricature of himself. The Bad News: It is historically so inaccurate that it drives you crazy. Lionel Barrymore was a very good actor, but for reasons I will explain his performance was way overwrought and overdone. The part called for him to play Rasputin as if he had the cunning and the outright intelligence to maneuver state heads to do his bidding. The movie was made in 1932 which was just 15 years from the actual Russian Revolution and so the people that made the movie really did not know what we know now. Even so the actual facts of the death of Rasputin were known and to my mind the truth was far more dramatic than the way this movie portrayed Rasputin's killing. Even then they knew that The Empress never did figure out what a scoundrel Rasputin was, whereas in the movie she finally sees through him and calls on John Barrymore to save the throne by getting rid of him.

However, of the three, Lionel is DEFINITELY the star and he's given ample opportunity to act and overact...and it's all very enjoyable to watch. His version of Rasputin certainly is NOT subtle.Now there is a problem with making a film about Rasputin and that is there is a lot of lore involved. Many of the supposed 'facts' are obvious exaggerations....with the man having weird mystical powers and his death is clearly NOT realistically portrayed in history books. Fortunately, MGM chooses to make Rasputin evil but 100% human and without laser shooting out of his eyes!The story begins in 1905, which is problematic since the film ends in mid-1918 with the murder of the Czar and his family. I say problematic because the children in the story never age! Additionally, although Rasputin had a personal relationship with the Czar and his family for about a decade, here in the film is looks like only a few months or perhaps a year. The fact is that the story wasn't intended as a history lesson and MGM made a few artistic changes here and there...something which probably made the film more enjoyable for most audience members.As far as portraying this evil monk goes, Lionel Barrymore imbued him an amazing over-the-top personality and humanized him. Humanized because the tricks he does in the film are simply tricks--such as hypnotism and spying on folks in order to 'magically' know their secrets. It's all very enjoyable to watch and never is dull.As for John, he has a relatively meaty role but is far, far more subdued. You do see him emote strongly during the murder sequence (one that varies tremendously with most accepted versions)....but otherwise he plays his role very straight.Ethel, on the other hand, has a rather normal and even somewhat bland role in the movie. Simply put, any decent actress could have done her part.So is it any good? Exceedingly so, yes. The story is never dull, is very big and exciting.

By contrast, Ethel is stately as the Empress Alexandra, but also rather uninteresting, mainly emphasizing womanly dignity and reserve, as she so often did. Often she and Diana Wynyard seem to be in a contest to see who can employ a more highfalutin pronunciation style. So it falls to John to give the best performance: He's comparatively naturalistic and understated, and seems most comfortable in front of a camera. The director, Richard Boleslawski, goes in for needlessly arty compositions and drags out the playing time, and Herbert Stothart, the composer, seems the hardest worker: so much Russian-cliché music, and so loud.

And we needed the big fight scene near the end. Plus it was quite unrealistic that the monk doesn't even get a scratch on him when the prince fires a bullet or two into him.

But turning Nicholas and Alexandra into intelligent and sympathetic characters wasn't really necessary.What I found most impressive in this movie was Lionel Barrymore's incarnation of Rasputin. Yes, it's very dramatic, and sometimes melodramatic. But so, evidently, was Rasputin. Barrymore presents him as a thoroughly repulsive creature completely devoid of morals, sometimes to the point of turning your stomach. The scene where he makes advances at one of the young daughters of the imperial couple is so well played that it's very hard to watch: you feel a terrible sense of revulsion at the suggestion of what Rasputin is clearly thinking about doing.The other scene that impressed me was the last one between Rasputin and the Russian noble played by John Barrymore. The latter definitely goes too far near the end, but Lionel B. is magnificent as the man who would not die.For me, the movie should have ended with that scene, or very shortly afterward. The rest of the movie is devoted to the final days of the imperial family.

tt0023374,The great Barrymores portray a fascinating piece of history,9.0,"""Rasputin and the Empress"" belongs in any good collection of movies for three reasons. First, it is the only movie with all three siblings of the great stage and screen family of Barrymore. Second, it is a reasonable portrayal, with facts and fiction, of the last years of the Russian czars and the infamous Rasputin. And, third, the film production is excellent. The acting by the entire cast is first rate. The sets capture the splendor of the place and the turmoil of the time. The filming is superb under Polish-born director Richard Boleslawski (as Boleslavsky) who studied at the Moscow Art Theater. And the plot and screenplay tell an interesting and bizarre story. Ethel Barrymore plays the Czarina Alexandra, wife of Czar Nicholas II, ruler of Russia. John Barrymore plays a fictitious character, Prince Chegodleff. His role is based on the real Prince Felix Yusupov. Lionel Barrymore has the largest role. He plays the diabolical Grigori Rasputin, the ""mad monk"" who mesmerized the Romanov family their last three years. His influence may have altered the history of Russia. It doubtless contributed to the end of the Romanov rule after three centuries. The detailed history of the time and events covered by this film makes fascinating reading. This movie was made just 14 years after the execution of the Czar and his family by the Bolsheviks in July of 1918. The film follows closely the events of the Romanovs and Rasputin from 1914 to1918. It begins with the arrival of Rasputin as a healer of the young Alexei, who was a hemophiliac. Rasputin wasn't a religious monk, but had a reputation as a mystical faith healer. After Alexei's recovery, Rasputin's influence with the royal family grew, especially through the Czarina. In time, his power was so great that some considered him the ruler of Russia. The film captures this situation very well. It also shows the royal family's faithful adherence to the Orthodox Church. In Hollywood fashion, and of necessity for the film's length and subject matter, much of the earliest years of the reign of Nicholas II is condensed into no more than some general references about the past. Nicholas was a timid man and a weak ruler with no stomach for governance. After he ascended the throne in 1896, he and Alexandra enjoyed a period of favor with the populace. They were well liked as rulers. But, the czar's poor skills of leadership in time led to many problems. He soon lost face with the people. And, when Rasputin came on the scene, public distrust further fanned the flames of rebellion. Besides the Barrymores, the film has a number of other fine actors. Ralph Morgan plays the weak Czar Nicholas perfectly. Diana Wynyard is superb as Natasha whose character was based on Irina Yusupov. Edward Arnold plays Doctor Remezov. C. Henry Gordon is the Grand Duke Igor. And Tad Alexander is The Czarevitch. Again, this is a fine film on all accounts. In 1917, there were 65 members in the Romanov dynasty. The Bolshevik's killed 18 of them and the 47 remaining either fled Russia or were exiled. Most went to Western Europe. A number of movies have been made about pretenders to the Romanov line. Sometimes those ruses were for prestige, but more often they were efforts to lay claim to some of the jewels of Russia. In 1934, Princess Irina Alexandrovna sued MGM in London over this film. She was a niece of Czar Nicholas, and the wife of Prince Felix Yusupov, who is the person who killed Rasputin. Earlier, MGM made some changes and deleted some scenes. But the princess still took issue with the fictitious character that John Barrymore plays. She also said that Rasputin didn't urge the Czar to go to war with Germany. Another matter of contention was the death of Rasputin. The film shows the gathering at the Molka Palace, which took place. But in the end it shows Barrymore's character dragging Rasputin's body to the river and pushing him under the ice. In the February 28, 1934, court case in London Prince Yusupov testified on the killing. ""When Rasputin disclosed what he was doing for Germany, I determined that he must die in the interests of Russia. I secured poison from a doctor, and accompanied Rasputin to the cellar, where I gave him poisoned cakes and wine, and shot him. He revived, whereupon another man thrice shot him, but not fatally. I then battered him to death with a loaded stick. Three friends removed the body and threw it in the river. I was arrested next morning and the Tsar banished me."" Other evidence in time found that the men who disposed of Rasputin's body threw him from a bridge into the river. This trial account, under a dateline London, appeared in the Brisbane, Australia Courier-Mail newspaper of March 2, 1934, page 15. Princess Yusupov won some damages for libel in England, and MGM settled with her out of court in the U.S. That apparently led to the standard disclaimer now used for most films based on fiction: ""All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental."" Several reviewers have said this film is very bad history. Perhaps some are reading too much into it. The film covers less than four years in time, and mostly focuses on the Romanov family and Rasputin. A lot about the previous years is condensed in a couple of general observations, as noted above.

tt0023374,A pre-Code film that feels post-Code,5.0,"Well, no surprise, but don't watch this for a history lesson. There are many problems, but to me the most damning thing is the treatment of the Romanovs. Despite this film being pre-Code, the power of the Studio Relations Committee was sometimes felt, and in this case, it rejected many drafts of the script because it portrayed the Romanovs too unsympathetically/realistically. Fifteen years after the revolution the jury was generally still out on Russia's experiment with communism (especially given the Depression that capitalism was enduring), but to the Catholic leaders in America driving the SRC, the communists were godless and hence evil. The Romanovs thus needed to be portrayed as benevolent and planning on allowing representative government on their own, which is laughable. As Mark Viera describes it in 'Forbidden Hollywood,' studio exec Irving Thalberg told screenwriter Charles MacArthur to turn the Romanovs into ""Mr. and Mrs. Hoover,"" so that's what he did.The real Rasputin was apparently quite a libertine, however, and while Lionel Barrymore doesn't seem to capture quite all of his mystical madness, in those piercing eyes he captures his evil. He's certainly the highlight of this film, despite that beard which is too obviously fake. There is some interest in it being the only film in which he, John, and Ethel appeared together, but this is clearly his show. We get some bits of Rasputin's licentiousness in his drinking parties and carrying on with a group of women, as one comments ""Why do you always bless the young and pretty ones?"", but unfortunately the much-referred-to lawsuit forced cuts to scenes alluding to rape, leading to less than understandable character behavior.The film sprawls on for two hours which was too long, and the plot is a melodramatic mess, which is too bad. The fight scene between John and Lionel towards the end is pretty good, but by then I just wanted it to be over. While Rasputin's death should have ended the film, I think the SRC needed the Romanovs made into Christ-like sacrificial figures, thus dragging it on longer.

Admittedly, that fact alone doesn't make it a 7, but seeing the three accomplished siblings together here (for the only time in celluloid history) IS worth a few extra points. This is an interesting tale, showing how an unknown/outsider was able to insert himself into the lives of the Russian royal family and influence them in ways one wouldn't think possible. I will say that the film goes out of its way to denigrate Rasputin. I don't think he needed any help, really, but in addition to his actual crimes, he is shown here to be a war-monger, royal rapist and freedom-hating enemy of the peasants. Lol that's quite a despicable guy! Some reviewers have complained that ""Rasputin"" is not always true to history (in some ways, it's not), but what this tells me is that Hollywood apparently has been making historically inaccurate films for perhaps longer than anyone thought. If you can forgive it that, it's otherwise pretty entertaining.Best line: ""You know, people with visions like yours, my dear father, are sometimes rather unlucky.

Here Montgomery is the one out of his element and we find him mystified by the sounds of crickets in the evening--something almost as strange and foreign to him as the unpretentious caring ways of the Miller family.

In both cases O'Sullivan has ""tamed"" the wild beast.""Tarzan"" was an adventure film, however--the journey takes place in the great outdoors and nature is a mirror.

tt0025251,The farmer's daughter,7.0,"""Hide Out"" starts out focusing on a group of racketeers operating in Manhattan. We are introduced to Jonathan Wilson, who seems to be a key man to the organization. Jonathan is clearly a ladies' man, but his luck is about to change after he is seen pursuing the glamorous Baby. In a hilarious scene, Jonathan, has secured a ring side table to watch the beautiful Baby singing, as part of a night club act. He proceeds to ask her for a date that same night, without the singer missing a beat while she accepts his invitation. That also proves to be his own undoing because the police is closing after him.The second part of this comedy, directed with style by W. S. Van Dyke, concentrates in how Jonathan, who has been wounded when he tried to flee his pursuers, is found on the side of the road by a Connecticutt farmer, Henry Miller. He takes him home, where the whole family takes an interest in making him well. The lovely Pauline Miller, a young teacher, likes ""Lucky"", as Jonathan calls himself. Life in the farm works its magic in this man and transform him when he falls in love with the beautiful Pauline.Of course, we all know that crime doesn't pay, so when at the end of the film we see Det. MacCarthy come knocking on the Miller's door, we realize that Lucky must pay for his evil ways of the past, although he makes us feel, because of his transformation and the love he feels for the young woman, that somehow, he has vindicated himself by wanting to stay in the farm forever.Robert Montgomery's appearance in the film makes it even better than what it should have been. Mr. Montgomery is excellent in his scenes with Maureen O'Sullivan, who is perfect as the young Pauline Miller. Pauline Patterson and Whitford Kane are the older Millers, and Mickey Rooney, who was about thirteen, but looks much younger, makes a valuable contribution as Willie Miller. Edward Arnold, one of the best character actors working in films at that time, puts an appearance as Detective MacCarthy.The film, with a running time of 81 minutes, has the right length and involves us in it.

tt0025251,Montgomery Shines,10.0,"I can't help it... I'm a sap for this film. Since seeing it last month, I have spoken to anyone and everyone about the charms and witty manner of this little delight on 9 reels. With Robert Montgomery and Maureen O'Sullivan, how can you go wrong? What can I say about this film that others here have not already said? Obviously, Montgomery is ultimately one of the most beautiful stars to ever grace any screen, silver or modern. His smile is contagious - Just adorable with a touch of deviance thrown in for good measure, and his accent makes every line funny.We begin with see him in his racketeer life style, he's mean and chases just about anything with a dress. Once circumstances force him to spend the morning in a little farm in the country, you could imagine ""Lucky's"" dismay. He wants out - and quick. That is until he catches sight of the gorgeous Pauline (casted flawlessly with Maureen O'Sullivan), all bets are off. Together, they share chemistry that is sure to satisfy anyone looking for a good love story.For Montgomery fans (like me), the scenes where Bob is opposite the farm animals are just priceless. It's hilarious to see him interact with them, often speaking to them like the gangsters and ""clients"" he once hassled back in the big city. The scenes with chickens are some of the most humorous, like when he goes to check the chicken coop for eggs... ""Hording, ay?"" he says, lifting one of the hens up. ""You did good, you know that, don't you?"" Before that, he feeds the chickens in one of his first attempts at mimicking farm life. When he bends down to feed them, one takes a good chomp at his finger. While Pauline is not looking, ""Lucky"" nearly settles the matter 'gangster' style. There's also an adorable scene with Pauline teaching ""Lucky"" to milk a cow. He's never quite ""on the level"" with his knowledge (or lack there of) of farm procedure. When Pauline hands him the pail for milking, he responds, ""Well, I'm used to a bottle but this will do."" The whole film we watch Robert Montgomery's character chase and chase Pauline, something always getting in the way of them being alone together. Finally, the rest of the family take a trip while nearly being pushed out the door by ""Lucky."" He hurries through the chores in anticipation of a picnic all alone with Pauline. When rain once again spoils ""Lucky's"" plans, they have to take shelter in a neighbor's cabin near the farm. Truly one of the most romantic scenes I've seen on film, they both sit together in front of the fire wrapped in blankets. Alone together at last, ""Lucky"" has been too caught up in the chase to realize he has fallen in love.What a wonderful movie! Both these stars and the supporting cast are pure magic on screen... I can be safe in saying they don't make them like this anymore. Everything about it is heart warming and make sure when you see it, it is on some medium you can replay: For sure it will take multiple viewings to get it out of your system.",23,24,True
tt0025251,Sweet,9.0,"""Sweet"" is not a word I've ever used to describe a film, mostly because the films that might merit the word are invariably too sappy to qualify. But ""Hide-Out"" pulls it off and truly deserves that description. Much like ""Bad Bascomb"" (1946) and ""Angel and the Badman"" (1947) this is the story of an incorrigible criminal who is reformed because of his accidental association with good people. In ""Hide-out"" they are not reformers and there is no deliberate effort to reform; the character change comes because the positive examples cause him to adopt their values and belief system.Robert Montgomery plays Lucky Wilson, a charming Broadway playboy who is part of a protection racket specializing in nightclubs. His boss gets a percentage of each club's profits and Lucky insures the payoff is correct by estimating each club's business from their napkin usage (a convenient procedure because they control the laundry the clubs use). The opening sequence is exceptionally well staged, with Lucky's insatiable appetite for women revealed through a montage of blonde conquests; in the opening minutes he goes from a girlfriend's maid, to the girlfriend, to another girlfriend waiting for him in a car, to a new conquest at the night club he visits. During the brief intervals between conquests he finds time to leer and flirt with every pretty girl who crosses his path. All these girls are blonds with lots of makeup and with elaborate hairstyles. Their appearances are meant to contrast with the natural appearance of Pauline Miller (Margaret O'Sullivan), the girl with whom he eventually falls in love.""Hide-Out"" is one of those films where the casting is perfect, as you cannot imagine anyone but Montgomery and O'Sullivan being able to pull this out without appearing completely silly. They are nicely assisted by Elizabeth Patterson (as Pauline's mother) and by a very young Mickey Rooney (as Pauline's younger brother Willie). The standing gag is Willie's frustrated attempts to get the family to call him Bill. His scenes with Montgomery are especially good and it is interesting how much natural acting talent he exhibits this early in his career. They go out on a standing gag about the reproductive abilities of the rabbits he has been raising.A big reason why the film works is the attention paid to the details,. A second viewing will reveal many things you do not even notice the first time around, like Montgomery's continuing discomfort with ""nature"" when he brushes a rose bush in the front of the house. There are hundreds of these little details, most of them involving the citified Montgomery's fish-out-of-water adjustments to country life.There was a 1941 remake titled ""I'll Wait for You"" staring Robert Sterling and Marsha Hunt. Although I love Marsha Hunt the 1934 original is easily the better film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",23,24,False

When a couple of smart cops get someone to spill the beans on his rackets, Lucky is forced to leave town in a hurry and head for a hideout, but he gets himself shot on the way out and ends up getting picked up on the road by a Connecticut farmer, who bunks injured Lucky in his quite lovely family home/farm. The kindly family proceeds to nurse Lucky back to health, but Lucky just wants to get out of there - until he meets the farmer's beautiful daughter Pauline (Maureen O'Sullivan). Soon he's feeding the chickens, milking the cow, picking cherries, chopping wood, and performing other farm chores (all dressed in his nice white shirt and jacket) all in pursuit of the girl. And the family has NO clue that Lucky is a criminal!Very entertaining film, with excellent performances by all including Elizabeth Patterson as the charitable farm wife/mom, and a young Mickey Rooney as the boisterous little brother/devoted rabbit farmer. Robert Montgomery is, as usual, charming and oh so attractive, and quite good at playing this gangster type role in addition to his usual roving playboy type - plus he has a good deal of chemistry with Maureen O'Sullivan here.

Eventually, though, his larcenous ways nearly get him killed and he is forced to escape to the countryside to avoid the law and heal following being shot by police in his escape.Montgomery is discovered by a nice and unsuspecting family who have no idea he's a crook. They sweetly agree to let him stay there and they treat him like a member of the family. While the dad is a pretty forgettable but nice character, long-time character actress Elizabeth Patterson does an amazingly effective job as the mother and Mickey Rooney is cute as a nice little boy who is all boy! The sister was played by a young Maureen O'Sullivan who is simply radiant. It isn't surprising that Montgomery soon falls for O'Sullivan, but her inherent decency and sweetness result in a change in the crook. Over time, he realizes for the first time that he truly cares about her--as well as the entire family. Is this predictable? Sure,...but it's handled so well and the film is so engaging that you probably won't mind--I know I sure didn't!

tt0025251,You can practically see the dividing line between the precode and code eras in this film,7.0,"It's a modest movie. Not a big deal. But it's got some things in it I like. First, it stars Robert Montgomery, and Maureen O'Sullivan, which though not a guarantee of a good movie, sure is a sign of promise. And in this case it pays off. Montgomery plays a racketeer who has to lam it to the countryside to wait for some heat to die down. The odd thing is, I could not really figure out what his ""racket"" was. There he is injured and stays with a family to recover, meeting and chumming it with the daughter. That's where the dividing line is. In the first part you are in precode gangster land. Then Montgomery wakes up in a four poster bed with a gingham bedspread - he has arrived in production code land. The plot's flimsy, for sure, on both sides of the line, but it's there to provide the opportunity for Montgomery and O'Sullivan to meet and chatter. And that's the main attraction. The banter between the simple, ingenuous, yet clear-headed and no-nonsense country lass, and the sophisticated, jaded, out-of-his-element city feller, as they get to know each other, like each other, and fall in love. The style of their exchanges has an informal, conversational feel, as if they were talking, not reciting lines.Of course, the love story is accompanied by his character reformation into a good person, or one that looks to be in the future. But it's handled discretely, and if you ignore it, it doesn't spoil things. The supporting cast is a bunch of pros, so they know how not to step on things: Elizabeth Patterson and Whitford Kane as the ma and pa, Mickey Rooney-for once not insufferably irritating playing an insufferably irritating son, and Edward Arnold as the dogged cop.

tt0025251,"""Either you want to stay in business--or you don't want to stay in business""",6.0,"A somewhat unusual crime drama in which Robert Montegomery literally hides out in rural New York to escape both the mob and the cops. At a farm, he's nursed back to health (from a gunshot wound) by Miller family. The farmer's daughter, Pauline (Maureen O'Sullivan) falls for Lucky/Jonathan (Montgomery). If that sounds goofy, it kind of is. The first part of the movie, by stark contrast, shows Lucky as a sharp but dangerous criminal, shaking down nightclub owners with his protection racket.The only thing Lucky retains when he rehabilitates with Pauline is his smooth wisecracking attitude. The nightclub scenes are great: typical of upper-class urban entertainment ninety years ago. Lucky isn't so fortunate with Baby, his girlfriend. Or a blond showgirl. But he's good at making the owners' squirm when he outlines his protection 'service.' when he talks about ""giving them a break"" on their linen service, it's to the tune of a nickel discount on a hundred napkins; even in 1934, that's not very helpful.The cops, led by Lt. McCarthy (Edward Arnold), scope out the situation; the Lieutenant knows Lucky is crooked, but the owners are afraid to complain. Among other amusing scenes, we see guys actually counting napkins in a laundry--to see that the nightclubs 'discount' isn't too good, apparently. Things escalate quickly, as a rival gang injured Lucky when he leaves the city. The Lieutenant eventually catches up with him. Meanwhile, Pauline and Lucky have plenty of time to get attracted to each other.Hide-Out has an interesting premise, and is filled with good performances (particularly the two leads). The comic aspect makes the fish-out-of-water plot work to some extent. But this really seems like two different movies joined by the cliff-hanger device of Lucky's escape from the city. I wonder what this would've felt like if we started with Lucky recuperating at the farm. His notorious background could've been sketched in by flashback. He ends up having to come clean with Pauline anyway. As it is, our initial impression is that Lucky is a creepy jerk. Assuming, if we want to buy the rest of the movie's logic, that he's really just a regular guy who needs to find himself, why begin with the assumption that he's a bad guy?Definitely gives a receptive quality to the romance.This is entertaining; but a bit muddled.

tt0025464,Cutting no corners,7.0,"'Manhattan Melodrama' may not have the stylistic finish to it to make it a great message movie about contemporary 30s issues, but it does go a long way towards that end, and is never less than engaging.Clark Gable is the happy-go-lucky gangster Blackie who is being tried for murder by his boyhood best friend Jim, William Powell, a D.A. who has made it to governor of New York because of a murder done by Blackie, unbeknownst to Jim. On top of it all they both love the same woman, Myrna Loy.Despite its melodramatic but never overwrought style 'Manhattan Melodrama' has sufficient weight and substance to make itself heard 70 years after the fact. It cuts no convenient corners in the description of the governor's sad plight of having to decide whether his friend should live or die, and it paints a wonderful and believable picture of Loy's character who does what she deems best. Powell delivers a multi-layered performance that has to count amongst his best, and Gable is irrepressible and delightfully amoral as the bad guy we're all rooting for.Recommended, but please don't judge it by the first 20 minutes which are rather slow-moving, but still entertaining.",45,48,False
tt0025464,A fascinatingly unusual drama,,"Well, unusual for me.  Perhaps at the time, the circumstances, what have you, it was not so unusual.  But for me, watching Clark Gable portray a happy-go-lucky double murderer, who garners tons of sympathy from the audience; it was a first.Manhattan Melodrama is a film of dubious and rather interesting morals. Who's the hero?  Who's the villain?  Childhood friends Jim and Blackie grow up very different men, Jim becomes DA of New York City, while Blackie runs a casino, and performs other unsavory activities.  Eventually, their positions force them into conflict, but it's not your typical run-of-the-mill courtroom drama. Blackie in most films would be a villain, he is after all a gangster and a murderer, amongst other activities.  But here he's played by Clark Gable, about as charming an actor as ever lived, and the movie takes place in the 1930s, when gangster pictures like Little Caesar elevated these types of men into hero roles.The picture makes a very blatant message against the heroic vision of gangsters (In a speech by Jim that feels as if the men who controlled the Production Code were standing off screen holding the cue cards for him). But I couldn't help feeling sympathy for the character, after the evil deeds he did.  Meanwhile Jim, a hardworking individual who is uncorruptable, comes off as ""cold"" by the end of the picture.  The way this movie sidesteps conventional roles is really interesting.The lead woman in the picture, Eleanor, is rather interesting too.  Watch how she jumps back and forth and between the men, and for what reasons. ;I don't fully understand this movie, and it's not one of the most exciting films I've ever seen, but it's one of the most interesting ones I've seen in quite a while.",38,43,False
tt0025464,John Dillinger Died For This Film,6.0,"Manhattan Melodrama is a trivial pursuit game all in itself. Consider the number of things it's known for. 1. The only teaming of Clark Gable and William Powell. 2. The first teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. 3. A popular song that didn't get popular from this film. 4. A famous gangster being shot to death because he wanted to see this. 5. William Powell's first film under the MGM banner. And I'm sure I might think of a few more later on.It's a very dated piece, but made enjoyable because of the skill of its three leads. Two kids, Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Butler who later become Clark Gable and William Powell, are left orphaned as a result of the famous General Slocum disaster in the first years of the 20th century. One works hard, studies hard, and becomes a successful lawyer and prosecutor. The other works hard becoming the kind of man the first one makes a living prosecuting.Gable's the gambler and his girl friend is Myrna Loy. Gable is his usual charming self, but with a streak of toughness and nobody crosses him. He runs into Powell at the famous Dempsey-Firpo fight and later Powell runs into Loy. She gets a taste of respectability through him and she likes it. Gable would probably be sore about losing her to anyone, but Powell.Powell rises to become governor of the state and Gable gets to the top of his profession, the death house at Sing Sing. This is where the film truly turns into melodrama. Powell is a person of exacting moral standards a bit too exacting for my taste. I can't see how today's audience could accept the course of action he pursues, for just being TEMPTED to commute Gable's sentence. Manhattan Melodrama features a song sung by Shirley Ross, The Bad in Every Man. It's a familiar tune, but didn't do anything for the film. Composer Richard Rodgers had faith in his melody however and persuaded his partner Lorenz Hart to try another lyric. He did and Connee Boswell recorded it and made Blue Moon a big hit.Of course the legend of the film is that John Dillinger wanted so much to see the film that he came out of hiding. As soon as it was over he got betrayed by one of the women accompanying him and the FBI gunned him down in the streets of Chicago. Manhattan Melodrama entered into American folklore after that.I'm not sure today's audience would feel this film was worth even John Dillinger's life. If he wanted to see Gable, Powell, and Loy so badly, he should have waited later in the year for It Happened One Night or The Thin Man.",35,42,True

But a crime drama?! The story is so silly I had to laugh out loud on one occasion. Gable tries to save what can be saved, but Powell is so hopelessly uncharismatic and uninteresting - plus his role is an even more thankless one than that of the others - so he doesn't do the movie any good, which is nothing new. I'll never understand how a guy like Powell could ever have been a movie star. (Did he have someone's nude-with-hooker photos?) The film's main characters represent the height of Hollywood's preposterousness; Gable and Powell play two men who could only exist on planet Subirax 7G, provided that Subirax has a hallucinogenic atmosphere and is the sort of ""unstable"" planet the hippie-astronauts from ""Dark Star"" enjoy blowing up. Powell is an ultra-principled and morally incorruptible man. I.e.: he shouldn't be a prosecutor and a politician. Gable's sky-high principles are only slightly lesser than Powell's; Hollywood has certainly given us many crooks with-the-heart-of-gold but Gable has more morals than a Latin-soap priest. And in which America is it possible for a man to become prosecutor in spite of a highly publicized and proved close friendship with a mob guy, and even get elected governor in spite of not only still being pals with the mob guy but marrying his former girl?! Only in Subiraxian's Manhattan.The heights of lunacy are reached in the last third when one ludicrous plot-twist trips over the next. Powell demands that Gable get a death sentence, and Gable doesn't even get that upset; he becomes relaxed when Powell apologizes for having to be so rough in the court-room! Later, Powell gets a chance to reprieve Gable but he can't bring himself to do it. And when Loy tells him that Gable killed to help Powell's career, the latter decides that that makes it even more wrong to pardon him! (This is probably where I laughed.) Gable's behaviour before his execution is so over-the-top Subiraxian that it easily matches and rivals Cagney's behaviour in the similarly-premised ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" where Cagney also acts as if the electric chair is just a harmless Toys'R'Us plaything! After the execution, the very predictable - and very unintentionally funny - happens: Powell resigns, displaying the most exaggerated Hollywoodesque super-high morality patheticness that one can imagine.I found it interesting that Mickey Rooney (i.e. Mickey Mouse, for they are about the same size) plays the young Gable! I mean, the similarities are so striking! (Then again, on planet Subirax 7G adolescents change far more while they transform into adults.)Very ironic that this is the movie Dillinger sneaked out (or in) to see before he got shot; to risk one's life for such a dumb movie...",13,40,True

Powell is in politics. After Loy spends some time with Powell, she decides she'd rather be with him, and eventually they marry, and Powell moves from DA to governor.

tt0025464,"Exceptionally entertaining, though far from a masterpiece",7.0,"This is a formulaic film that is very reminiscent of many of Clark Gable's films of the era (particularly SAN FRANCISCO) as well as the crime dramas that made Warner Brothers so popular in the 1930s--though this film IS from MGM. If the film had different stars, such as Jimmy Cagney or John Garfield, you would have just assumed it was a Warner project because they made so many similar gangster films--ones where the mobster is glib and carefree but ultimately doomed to pay for his crimes. Now to me, being formulaic isn't a bad thing at all. I love watching these type films and could do so again and again because they are so entertaining. After all, it's hard NOT to enjoy a film starring Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy--they were dynamite actors and professionals. Sure, they often tended to play the same type of character again and again, but you grew to love them and look forward to this because the films were so consistently good and exciting. Plus, as always, the writing, direction and production values were top-notch for the period. This predictability and consistency make this a very, very good film but also, unfortunately, keep it from getting a really high score because there isn't a whole lot new about the film as well.Gable plays a professional gambler and killer named, what else, ""Blackie"" (big surprise, huh). His childhood pal, William Powell, is the district attorney who eventually runs for governor. In SAN FRANCISCO this similar type role was played by Spencer Tracy--but the formula remained intact. Myrna Loy is the woman who loves them both. When Blackie kills a man as a favor to Powell (who NEVER would have approved--he was just too decent in the film), Powell is faced with the dilemma of prosecuting him! Sure it's predictable and almost impossible to believe, but this doesn't matter too much due to the film's quality throughout--that is up until the end. The film SHOULD have ended with Gable's final scene but instead has an ending that immediately follows it that just seems tacked on and unsatisfying. The movie should have ended about five minutes sooner.The film is a must see for fans of Hollywood's Golden Age or fans of Gable or fans of gangster films. All others will still probably enjoy it, but might also find the plot elements a bit hard to believe.",14,16,True
tt0025464,"""If I can't live the way I want, then at least let me die the way I want""",8.0,"From what I can gather, two main social factors led to the popularity of the gangster genre in the 1930s. The first, and most obvious, was the prevalence of criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger, who were glorified by the national media. The second was the Great Depression, and how it impacted the traditional notion of the ""American dream."" Families – regardless of character or social standing – were torn apart amid the economic collapse, and no doubt many ordinary citizens contemplated crime as the route to happiness.Films like 'Manhattan Melodrama (1934)' and 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)' place great emphasis on the thin line between ""good"" and ""bad"" characters, and often the central criminals are lamented as victims of circumstance. For example, James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien's virtuous priest were separated by a matter of metres when the former is condemned to a life of crime. Circumstance, too, drives the fates of the characters in 'Manhattan Melodrama.' As children, both Jim Wade (William Powell) and Blackie Gallagher (Clark Gable) lose their parents in the burning of the steamship SS General Slocum, a true-life disaster caused by gross negligence that cost over 1000 lives. Each child responds to this injustice in their own way: Blackie rebels against the judicial system that betrayed him, whereas Jim enters law in a bid to reform it.Whereas Warner Bros. was responsible for most of the decade's gangster films, 'Manhattan Melodrama' was produced by M-G-M, and helmed by W.S. Van Dyke (director of the first four 'Thin Man' films), whose decidedly non-gritty aesthetic style at first seems at odds with the required mood. However, it would be misleading to compare the film with the likes of 'Little Caesar (1931)' and 'Scarface (1932).' Firstly, Hollywood was now working, for the first time, under the active supervision of the Production Code Administration. Also, the studio's intentions for the film were undoubtedly geared towards a higher-brow audience, further suggested by the unintimidating, woman-friendly title.Gable's ""Blackie"" Gallagher is not a paranoid hot-head like Tony Camonte or Rocky Sullivan, and, indeed, remains oddly passive throughout the film. When he does commit murders, it seems to be merely out of an obligation to genre conventions. Even when old friend Jim Wade dramatically demands his execution, Blackie looks on with a detached, amused smirk, doodling idly from the defendant's chair; the expected outburst of emotion never arrives. Instead, the story's central conflict unfolds entirely within the righteous Wade, who must choose between his personal and professional allegiances.'Manhattan Melodrama' has achieved some notoriety for being the film that killed John Dillinger, so to speak. The fugitive bank-robber was gunned down by FBI agents as he emerged from a screening at Chicago's Biograph Theatre on July 22, 1934 (clips from the film were recently featured in Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies (2009)'). These curious circumstances can't help but make one ponder what Dillinger had thought of 'Manhattan Melodrama.' Had he, like Blackie, accepted that his time was coming to an end? Did he welcome death over a lifetime of legal persecution? At the very least, he checked out having experienced a very fine addition to the genre.",13,15,False
tt0025464,So terrible,1.0,"The message of this movie is so awful, I almost hate to give it any attention by reviewing it at all. But, since it's Clark Gable week here at Hot Toasty Rag, here I go:The start of the movie is very sad, setting the stage for the titular melodrama. Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Butler are on a boat with their families for an afternoon party, when suddenly a fire breaks out. The boat is destroyed and several people are dead; Mickey and Jimmy are orphans. Adopted by a kind man whose son was killed, the boys grow up together but with different values. Mickey gets into trouble and Jimmy studies hard in school. As the years pass, they turn into Clark Gable, who owns a speakeasy, and William Powell, the district attorney about to throw his hat in the ring for governor of New York.Clark's girlfriend is Myrna Loy, but she's decided she wants a change. She's no longer satisfied with living the high life of a gangster's moll; she wants to become respectable and settle down. Clark's not the man for her, so as quick as lightening, she switches her affections to Bill. The audience is supposed to be okay with it because Clark was supposed to meet both of them for dinner but was irresponsible and didn't show up; snooze lose? Although Bill rattles off a hilarious line as they're getting to know each other, ""I was born at home, because I wanted to be near Mother at the time,"" I still couldn't root for him. He was a traitor to his brother!The movie continues to be rigged against Clark and for Bill's ridiculous ethics. He supposedly values the law and integrity more than anything else, but how is the audience supposed to applaud him when he ends up hurting so many people in the process? He's a terrible person; and there were so many easy fixes along the way that could have prevented him from making the wrong choices, but I don't think the audience was supposed to have figured those plot holes out.I hated this movie, and I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it. Not even if you love Bill and Myrna from the Thin Man movies and want to see another pairing. They made 14 movies together, so pick something else. If you love Clark Gable, don't even think about renting it. He gets betrayed and thrown under the bus so many times I lost track.",2,14,False
tt0025464,Film's only distinction is the John Dillinger background story...,6.0,"This was the film John Dillinger was watching in Chicago, the last one he saw before being shot to death as he left the theater. That film history fact is about the only real distinction this well named ""melodrama"" has.Once again, it's a buddy story for Gable, this time the childhood pal of WILLIAM POWELL. Seems he and CLARK GABLE were boyhood buddies when they were kids, with one guy taking the straight and narrow path (guess which one?) and the other becoming a gangster with a heart of gold. Both of them love the same woman (MYRNA LOY). Where have you heard that one before? Surprisingly, it won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay by Arthur Caesar in '35, at a time when these story elements may have seemed new. The cast surrounding the stars is an excellent one and Woody Van Dyke II directed with his usual skill, but there's no doubt of the film's dated attitudes and style as an old-fashioned melodrama.Trivia note: Hardest to accept is the fact that Mickey Rooney grows up to be Clark Gable! The mawkish melodrama starts with Mickey and his boyhood chum losing their parents in a shipboard fire and being adopted by a kind old man. The calendar moves on and before we know it the kids are a grown-up CLARK GABLE (who has become a gambler called ""Blackie"") and the studious friend, WILLIAM POWELL, who has studied to be a lawyer while Gable is at a roulette table most of the time. If the story sounds familiar, you might be thinking of ""San Francisco"" which had Gable and Tracy taking different paths and in love with the same woman--this time it's MYRNA LOY.Loy plays her role as though it's an extension of her Nora role in ""The Thin Man"", so nothing seems fresh and original about the characters. Gable's not at his best with a short haircut and no sideburns that make his ears so prominent and a pencil thin mustache. Powell is his usual debonair self but the love triangle has a rather predictable outcome with Loy wavering between the two men but preferring Powell's gallant behavior to the brusque Gable.The saving grace of the screenplay is the unpredictable ending which has Powell forced to make a moral choice and reviewing his own sense of ethics. It's a well done examination of self, brought on by his great friendship with Gable and the final scenes are effectively played.Too slow for modern audiences, the film is notable only for the good chemistry between the stars but is overly melodramatic at every turn.

Clark Gable and William Powell play childhood friends who grow up to be a hood and a respected judge, respectively. Both have a thing for Myrna Loy, but the expected rivalry for which this plot would seem to be tailor made never comes. Instead, there's a refreshingly serious story about the boundaries of loyalty and friendship. When Gable is accused of murder and sentenced to the death penalty, it is Powell's duty to decide whether or not to let his personal feelings for Gable interfere with his practice of legal justice. Loy pops up throughout, but, unfortunately, she's window dressing. (Side note: My wife and I decided to have a Myrna Loy theme to our New Year's movie night, and rented this and ""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer.""

tt0025464,This film seems like it is warming up for a couple of other films...,6.0,"... those being ""San Francisco"" given the impact a disaster has on a community and the friendship as well as adversarial relationship the two male leads have to one another - with Gable being named ""Blackie"" in that one too, and the other being ""The Thin Man"" which reunites William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Nat Pendelton in a much better production that fires on all cylinders. Of course, both of these were directed by the director of this film, W. S. Van Dyke. That being said, this film doesn't seem nearly as good as it could have been.The plot is this - Two friends grow up in the shadow of tragedy caused by sudden loss. The younger one is Blackie Gallagher (Clark Gable) and is always trying to work an angle - usually involving gambling - even before the tragedies. The older one is Jim Wade (William Powell) always studying, always chiding Blackie for his slacker and crooked ways, but always his friend. In adulthood, Blackie is a big time gambler and casino owner and is not adverse to murdering associates and Jim becomes district attorney in New York. And yet whenever they meet they seem fast friends. Eleanor (Myrna Loy) starts out Blackie's girl but decides she wants the conventional marriage she'll never get from Blackie and eventually marries Jim.. At this point I was starting to get bored with this morality tale until some of Blackie' s criminal acts cross paths with Jim's official duties where complications ensue.There is just something off about this film. For one, Jim is supposed to be an uncorruptible political star destined for higher office but within the details of the film instead seems hopelessly naive and inflexible. Myrna Loy makes the transition from gangster moll to pious first lady in the blink of an eye, and even when she is with Blackie she is nagging him to ""quit the rackets"". Where did she think those marvelous evening gowns came from? There's just no way I'm believing Blackie is as ruthless in the rest of the film as he is shown to be and is just so ""Oh gee whiz what class Jim has!"" in response to things that impact his male pride (Eleanor), his livelihood, and even life itself. I guess none of this is as ridiculous as being expected to believe that Mickey Rooney grows up to be Clark Gable, but still the inconsistent characterizations are bothersome.I'd say it is probably worthwhile overall and just to give it a pass as some of the weirdness may have been caused by confusion over just what exactly the production code, which began to be enforced two months after this was released, would allow.",11,11,False
tt0025464,A Damaging Aspect,,"No need to recap the plot or the Dillinger sidelight. You might think that with the slick production, energetic direction, and A-grade cast, the results would be A-grade. But they're not. The script badly compromises itself by insisting that gangster Blackie (Gable) remain preternaturally steadfast to his friendship with DA Wade.Because of that, we get Blackie's (Gable) ludicrous behavior in the death house, where he treats impending death as something of a joke. After all, if Blackie betrays any note of even anxiety in the face of death, Wade might be blamed for causing it. That's because it's he, the DA, who sentenced Blackie to the ultimate punishment. But, of course, Wade relents at the last moment, wanting to commute Blackie's sentence on the basis of their friendship. However, that would betray his oath of office, so Blackie refuses the commutation, knowing it would discredit his District Attorney friend. As a result, we get more of the utterly ridiculous death house scene that Blackie laughs his way through so as not to compromise Wade in any fashion. At least, one sober note in the face of 20,000 volts would certainly have helped plausibility, but we get none. To me, at least, this undermines the movie's overall credibility, ode to friendship or not. Looks to me as though MGM wanted to put their budding stars in the best possible light regardless of damage to the story. But undermine an otherwise well-produced story they did.",7,9,True
tt0025464,The First Powell and Loy Pairing On screen,8.0,"Yes, this is a melodrama all right. Two boys of very different backgrounds are orphaned when a pleasure steamer catches fire and sinks in the Hudson River near New York in 1902. One boy (Mickey Rooney) is a rough and tumble type, while the other is bookish and thoughtful. They are both briefly adopted together by a man who lost his son in the same disaster. They grow up together and then go their separate ways. The rough one, 'Blackie', becomes a criminal and is played by Clarke Gable. The bookish one becomes a lawyer and criminal prosecutor, played by William Powell. Blackie has a girlfriend, played by Myrna Loy, who leaves him for Powell. What is so especially fascinating about this film is that Myrna Loy and Clark Gable do not 'click' at all, and glaze over when they look at one another, despite their best acting efforts to simulate at least some flickers of passion. But as soon as Powell and Loy are on screen together, the fizz begins, and they spark off one another like two cheeky little flints who just can't wait to make wonderful fire together. Powell seems to have been an irresistibly amusing man who was attractive to all the most glamorous gals, despite not being all that good-looking. After all, he was married to Carole Lombard and then was about to marry Jean Harlow when she died tragically. (He paid $30,000 for her funeral and took six weeks off filming with Myrna Loy in another picture because of his uncontrollable grief.) So Powell certainly knew how to interact with women of character. Myrna Loy just had the right kind of wry and whimsical manner to complement the dry humour of Powell. From the moment they first look at each other in this first film together, a unique screen magic was born, and lasted through 14 films. When I knew her very slightly as a youngster, she was 57 and rather uncommunicative, and she seemed depressed, so I never knew the 'lively Loy'. In those days videos and DVDs did not exist, so few people of my age had any idea at all of what she had been like in her films with William Powell, as we had not only never seen any of them but had no way of doing so. Nor was there any internet with a handy IMDb database where you just click your mouse and see the list of her credits. The fact is, Myrna Loy was someone one knew had been a big movie star earlier on, but one had never actually seen her on screen. She was just a name, and someone who had been in films which one's parents had seen before one was born. Well, now we can see them and so many of them are good that we can at last see Myrna Loy in perspective and appreciate just how unique and special she really was. There is a curious thing, namely that her real name was Myrna Williams and she came from Montana. Now who does that remind you of? Why, Michelle Williams of course, who comes from Montana (see my reviews of LAND OF PLENTY and INCENDIARY, where I note that this girl is an actress of genius). I wonder if they could possibly be Montana kith and kin. But I guess the world is full of people named Williams, even in Montana, which has a population of just a few thousand people and a few million cattle, doesn't it? It seems that everywhere you go, there are people named Wiliams. Perhaps it is because they are plural. Oh, back to the story. I always forget the story. Well, you can see it coming, can't you? Powell ends up prosecuting Gable for murder and demands the death sentence. That part of the story is heavily contrived, but it works very well regardless because after all it is a 1930s movie. Loy is distressed because she loves them both. You can see where the melodrama comes in, and they really lay it on, as this is not a film where subtlety is a leading quality. We get the whole thing, death row, the last minute requests for a reprieve (oh yes, Powell is Governor of New York by now and is the one who gets begged to save Blackie's life). Well the melodrama just keeps piling on top of the melodrama like that, so that the film is really a kind of melodramatic club sandwich. There is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there. Take a bite, it's really delicious.",4,9,False

I didn't see it in 1934, I saw it last night; and the trouble is that almost anybody my age has seen 1938's San Francisco wherein Clark Gable once again played the semi-bad guy called Blackie, and the story was similar. The greatness of ""San Francisco"" now dwarfs this earlier one. The movie also suffers from having Clark Gable, Merna Loy and William Powell in a romantic triangle. Sorry, but none of the three has much magnetism -- however good their acting.Most likely you won't (like John Dillinger) be gunned-down while renting from the video shop, but just for luck why not play it safe and order this one on Netflix.",1,9,False

Also couldn't find fault with the pacing.I was particularly impressed by the stellar job turned in by William Powell, showing more depth and sensitivity than in most of his films, especially in the climactic scene. And could anyone but Clark Gable make you root for a bad guy the way he could?

tt0025464,John's Last Picture Show,8.0,"A hugely popular film when first released in May 1934, ""Manhattan Melodrama"" is today historically important for three distinct reasons. It was the first picture to feature the by-now-common story line of two boyhood friends who grow up to become opponents in the realm of criminal justice. It saw the first pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy, whose chemistry on screen here worked so well that they would ultimately be teamed 14 times together in films. And, of course, it was the last picture seen by the notorious bank robber John Dillinger, who, upon exiting Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934, was killed during a gun battle with police and G-men. Today, almost 80 years since its release, the film still retains its impact and wonderful entertainment value, thanks largely to a terrific script and the megawatt star power of its three leads.In the film, we meet two young chums, Jim Wade and ""Blackie"" Gallegher (the latter played by 13-year-old, 14th billed Mickey Rooney). After the sinking of the General Slocum steamship on the East River on June 15, 1904, in which over 1,000 lives were lost, the boys are left orphans, soon taken in by a kindly Jewish man. When their benefactor is killed in a riot shortly thereafter, the boys are left to their own devices. Jim grows up to become the N.Y.C. D.A. and ultimately N.Y. state governor; the personification of moral rectitude, as played by William Powell. Blackie, on the other hand, as played by Clark Gable (here just a few months after the February 1934 release of ""It Happened One Night""), grows up to become an underworld figure and professional gambler. Strangely enough, the two remain staunch friends, although trouble does loom when Blackie's moll, Eleanor Packer (yes, Myrna Loy), throws him over and marries Wade. And then things become even more problematic, when Blackie kills a man and D.A. Wade must prosecute the case and find the killer....Harking back to Dillinger, I must say that if you are ever given the choice as to what your last movie will be before being executed, you could do a lot worse than ""Manhattan Melodrama."" All three stars are given ample opportunities to shine here: Gable is extremely likable, his faithfulness to his old buddy never wavering; Powell gives two tremendous speeches, one in the courtroom as he urges for the death penalty for his old friend, the other in front of the State Assembly; and Loy is just as sexy and beautiful as can be. The film's script just sparkles (the picture won an Oscar for Best Original Story), and the events depicted move along briskly and with not a bit of flab. A quick check of the names behind the camera might convince potential viewers of what a class production ""Manhattan Melodrama"" is. The film was produced by the legendary showman David O. Selznick, cowritten by the famed Joseph L. Mankiewicz, lensed by one of Hollywood's foremost cinematographers, James Wong Howe, and features a tune, ""The Bad In Every Man,"" by Rodgers & Hart. (Lorenz Hart would later rewrite the lyrics and turn it into the familiar standard ""Blue Moon""!) Not to mention the crackerjack direction of W.S. Van Dyke, who would go on to helm four of the six ""Thin Man"" films starring Powell and Loy, and three films with Gable, including ""San Francisco."" Perfect entertainment package that the film is, it also offers the viewer a trip to Harlem's Cotton Club, a hockey game at Madison Square Garden AND a horse race at Belmont (during which the boys get out of Manhattan for a while, for an afternoon in Queens). Plus, we are also given some very amusing comedic relief, thanks to the antics of one of Blackie's henchmen, Spud (played by Nat Pendleton), and his dim-witted galpal Annabelle (Isabel Jewell). What most viewers will most appreciate, though, I feel, is the solid camaraderie that Blackie and Wade enjoy, although life has set them in opposition. Indeed, Blackie's love for Wade never flags, even while he is sitting on Death Row. And I'd like to think that as Dillinger felt the first bullet enter his body, he flashed back to Blackie's Death Row words: ""Die the way you lived, all of a sudden. That's the way to go. Don't drag it out. Living like that doesn't mean a thing....""",6,7,True
tt0025464,Historic but Tame,,"Manhattan Melodrama (1935) ** 1/2 (out of 4) MGM crime drama about two friends who go on the opposite sides of the law. One becomes a gangster (Clark Gable) the other a D.A. (William Powell) and the two's common ground, a woman (Myrna Loy). The story of two friends ending up on opposite sides was warn out by 1935 and this here brings down the film. Both the gangster side and the drama side are pretty bland for the times and this too takes away from the film but there's no doubt that the three leads make it more entertaining than it deserves. Gable is terrific in his role and his scenes with Powell are certainly energetic. Loy steals the show as the woman who loves both men. At 93-minutes the film goes on a bit too long but it's worth at least one viewing for the cast. Mickey Rooney plays Gable's character as a child. This film is a part of American history since it was the movie John Dillinger was watching when the police killed him afterwards.",4,7,False

tt0026144,Full-on MGM musical classic!,10.0,"The movie musical of the 1930s studio system period arguably offered the only 100% use of the film medium. All singing, all dancing, all talking' was not then simply a catch phrase; it was what the audience demanded, entertainment pure and simple, 70 minutes or more, during which time they could escape the lingering effects of the Depression. Although Warner Brothers and Busby Berkeley were responsible for the rise and rise of the 1930s musical, MGM came out with Broadway Melody of 1936' which subtly lifted the genre a step higher through the talents of the greatest dancer ever to appear on the screen, Eleanor Powell. Fred had grace (and Ginger) and Gene had strength but Eleanor had both grace AND strength. She needed no partner, either! Three numbers stand out in Broadway Melody of 1936'. The first, Broadway Rhythm', is a hypnotic combination of music and dance which stands the test of time well no matter how you approach it. For example, the lighting and photography is simply stunning, not unusual from the best musical crew available at any Hollywood studio at the time - possibly any time. The musical backing is likewise; this is a number I've watched and listened to hundreds of times without loss of enjoyment. Francis Langford's wonderful (dubbed for Eleanor) voice grips you and before too much longer, once Eleanor moves onto the dance floor, you are swept up in the feeling of the times. It's difficult to believe this was her first starring role; as Eleanor dances into the camera, her eyes sparkling, you know she's dancing just to please you. There IS love at first sight and this surely must have been the effect on audiences back in the 1930s who took this great performer into their hearts, as box office takings proved. In addition to Eleanor, we have the lovely June Knight dancing with Nick Long, Jr and these two are great together. What a pity they never paired in any other movies. Likewise, Buddy Ebsen and sister Vilma, who are a terrific duo. Yes, I could probably write a book on this number.I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin' is equally as memorable as Broadway Rhythm' for similar reasons. Technically marvellous (how were the pop-up' effects achieved?) and great fun to watch, we have the sight of arguably the most handsome guy ever to grace the movies, Robert Taylor, bursting into song and yes, he's good, helped by the words of a great song. Stage actress June Knight is a perfect partner, with her facial expressions adding another dimension to the experience. The refrain brings Nick Long, Jr on stage for a knock-em down performance, the first part of which sees him seemingly bouncing with little effort over a row of chorus girls, one by one, followed by a double pirouette. Then comes the return of a sensual June Knight encased in the sexiest dress ever to grace the screen (just my opinion), white and complicated though split to the waist at the front. June and Nick then go into a dance in which the lady offers herself to the gentleman in a manner similar to that seen in films of wildlife in the African jungle. June spins into the camera and my, what a great set of legs!;Finally, You are My Lucky Star' sees Eleanor Powell (voiced by Francis Langford) follow up the song with an exhibition of ballet which must have left the audience with heads spinning. So many memorable moments in one movie and a lot of hard work for the participants, according to Eleanor in an interview with John Kobal (People Will Talk', Aurum Publishing, 1986). For this third number she often had to remove blood-soaked ballet slippers at the end of the day and soak her feet in ice. Originally production of the movie shoot was supposed to last a month (for which Eleanor asked a fee of $1250) but it eventually ran for four months. The final result, though, was a 7-year contact from Louis Mayer for Eleanor.Although this movie hasn't arrived on DVD, it's only a matter of time.

tt0026144,Broadway Rhythm,8.0,"Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1935), directed by Roy Del Ruth, from an original story by Moss Hart, with choreography by Dave Gould and Albertina Rasch, marked the new beginning in the cycle of MGM musicals that would be carried through the 1950s. Minus Technicolor thus far, which would become the standard by the mid 1940s, this production has more song and dance, lavish sets and a bright score than in previous years. Capitalizing on the enormous Academy Award winning success of THE Broadway MELODY (1929), this new edition plays more on the current trend of sassy comedy highlighted by new songs by resident composers Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, along with a lineup of new faces featuring Eleanor Powell, Buddy and Vilma Ebsen, Frances Langford, Harry Stockwell and Nick Long Jr. Of the newcomers appearing in the specialty acts, it's Eleanor Powell who would become the overnight ""lucky star,"" in her MGM debut. Not only does she tap dance her way to fame, she does an imitation of Katharine Hepburn from a scene in MORNING GLORY (RKO, 1933) to acting the role of the fictitious French actress, Mademoiselle LaBelle Arlette. The story also takes time for an assortment of snoring sounds, compliments of Mr. Hornblow (Robert Wildhack). He would repeat this gimmick again in Broadway MELODY OF 1938 (1937), changing from snores to sneezes. Broadway MELODY OF 1936 starts off like a vaudeville show combined with comedy, skit and songs interacted in the storyline, but by the second half, becomes cliché musical show preparations.Starting off like an intended sequel to the 1929 edition, the plot deals with Bert Keeler (Jack Benny), a columnist only reporting on who's going to have a baby, is advised by his managing editor (Paul Harvey) that, in order to boost up circulation, he must go out and report something of real interest. With his assistant, ""Snoop"" (Sid Silvers), Keeler improves himself by becoming a real gossip columnist. He starts off by writing about Park Avenue widow Lillian Brent (June Knight, an Ann Sothern look-alike), who's investing $60,000 on Broadway producer Robert Gordon's (Robert Taylor) latest show, ""Broadway Rhythm"" Brent's reasons aren't honorable because she's only using Gordon to break into show business. The circulating news on Gordon and Brent in the tabloids has the angry Gordon rushing his way through the World Tribune (on three separate occasions), followed by a gust of wind blowing away stacks of papers, into Keeler's office and giving him a good sock on the nose. This doesn't discourage Keeler, for that with each sock makes him the most read and talked about gossip columnist in the business, thus, earning a big paycheck raise from his editor. Later, Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) of Albany, comes to New York look up Gordon. Formerly high school sweethearts, she believes he could give her a break in one of his shows. She is soon discouraged when Gordon insists she return home and forget about her ambition for that Broadway isn't a place for a nice girl like her. With the help of Kitty Corbett (Una Merkel), Gordon's secretary, she arranges for Irene in masquerading as a fictitious French star, originally created by Keeler, to boost up circulation, to audition for the show. Featured in the musical program are: ""The Broadway Melody"" (sung by Harry Stockwell); ""You Are My Lucky Star"" (sung by Frances Langford); ""I Gotta Feelin' You're Foolin'"" (sung by June Knight and Robert Taylor, danced by Knight and Nick Long Jr.); ""Sing Before Breakfast"" (sung by Buddy and Vilma Ebsen/ danced by Eleanor Powell); ""I Gotta Feelin' You're Foolin'"" (sung by Frances Langford); ""You Are My Lucky Star"" (sung by Eleanor Powell); ""All I Do Is Dream of You"" (unknown French vocalist on record); ""On a Sunday Afternoon"" (sung and danced by The Ebsens); ""Broadway Rhythm"" (sung by Frances Langford/ danced by Eleanor Powell); and ""You Are My Lucky Star"" (sung by cast). Of the production numbers, ""I Gotta Feelin' You're Foolin'"" won the Academy Award as best dance direction. While this particular number plays like a scene within a scene in a Broadway show, it's actually part of the plot. This would be the only time Robert Taylor would sing on screen. Nick Long Jr., a hoofer who physically resembles Fred Astaire, dances like Gene Kelly. ""Sing Before Breakfast"" has the Ebsen's singing and dancing on the rooftop of their apartment, with Powell going into her dance face front towards the camera while the Ebsens watch her from behind. ""You Are My Lucky Star"" is seen through the mind of Powell as she daydreams herself as the leading performer in a show to a full theater of patrons. Of the hit tunes, only ""On a Sunday Afternoon"" failed to catch on.In the finished product, it's evident that Eleanor Powell would become the star of tomorrow, considering several extreme close ups of her throughout. Considering she was not an accomplished singer as she was a dancer, MGM prepared Frances Langford as her backup in the vocalizing department. As for Jack Benny doing his Walter Winchell impersonation, it would be a few short years before achieving fame as the stingy Jack Benny audiences got to all know and love. Una Merkel and Sid Silvers (who has one hilarious scene disguised as Mademoiselle Arlette) make an unlikely pair who add to several humorous scenes. In 1936, Powell, Merkel, Buddy Ebsen, Langford and Silvers would be reunited once more in another tune feast titled BORN TO DANCE. In spite of its pros and cons, Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (which was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 1935), is a very lively musical-comedy 1930s style worth viewing. This Eleanor Powell showcase, presented occasionally on Turner Classic Movies, is also available on video cassette and DVD. (***1/2)",30,33,False
tt0026144,Eleanor Powell Steals The Show,8.0,"When critics talk about the Thirties being the era of escapist entertainment, believe me they have Broadway Melody of 1936 in mind.For people like my parents growing up in the midst of The Depression this world where everyone wore tuxedos and danced away at rooftop parties in between Broadway shows can only be described as escapist.The nice thing about escapist films is that the plot really doesn't have to make sense. You couldn't have a Broadway producer as young as Robert Taylor, he was 25 when this came out. And certainly a talent like Eleanor Powell would certainly have been discovered long before Taylor rediscovers his old grade school chum from Albany.The plot such as it is involves producer Taylor and Walter Winchell like columnist Jack Benny engaging in a feud. During the course of things Benny creates a fictitious French stage star who is visiting New York. Later Taylor ""discovers"" Eleanor Powell masquerading as the fictitious Mademoiselle Arlette and signs her for his show.Taylor and Benny are fine and Jack Benny gives a good performance in a character that is free of the usual Jack Benny clichés he so carefully created for his radio persona. But the film really belongs to Eleanor Powell. You look at her dance and then you look at Ruby Keeler over at Warner Brothers and there just ain't a contest. Powell was primarily a dancer, but she had good comic timing, could put over a song, and even act decently.You will also like June Knight as the rich girl Taylor is courting for financial backing of his show. And Sid Silvers as Benny's sidekick is pretty funny especially in drag and with his scenes with Una Merkel.",30,31,False
tt0026144,They Just Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,10.0,"The Broadway Melody of 1936 is my all-time favorite movie. One day I was watching the special features on the Singin' In the Rain 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. I watched the ""Broadway Rhythm"" excerpt from this movie and the ""I've Got a Feelin"" You're Foolin' excerpt, too. After viewing I was all ""What was that?"" So I watched them again. After the 4th time, I was hooked. So I bought the whole movie about a year ago and here I am today, commenting on it.The B.M. of 1936 is an amazingly likable movie. The plot is flimsy like most other musicals of the Golden Age, but it's really, really, funny. The other reviewers summed up the plot correctly so I guess I won't be able to add anything new to that. But the smooth blend of plot and musical numbers are so dynamic that it the whole finished product just blows you away.Now, for the stars. We have Jack Benny, in pretty much top-form as a newspaper gossip columnist. He is very likable in his role, because he (typical of 30's musicals) heroically does a good deed in the end despite all the trash he printed.Sid Silvers is extremely hilarious as his hare-brained assistant and the scenes where he pretends to be Arlette's secretary are really funny.This is Buddy and his sister Vilma's 1st film and Vilma's last. They are cute here as Eleanor's friends, and their dance numbers are really cute, too.Nick Long Jr. has to be seen to be believed in the ""Foolin'"" number. I've never seen any dancer on screen, not even Fred Astaire do stuff like that.Una Merkel is her usual wise-cracking, voice-of-reason self as Robert Taylor's secretary, and does top-notch work, as usual.Little-known Broadway and B-movie actress June Knight gives an wonderful performance as the young, snooty widow who puts up the money for the show. Though probably the closest thing to a villain in the movie, she comes across as extremely likable because of the ah-mazing musical number with Robert Taylor and her wonderfully comedic acting. I don't think this movie would've become my favorite if she weren't in it.Robert Taylor is as usual, way handsome, suave, and likable. There's really nothing more i can say about him except that he's terrific. And hunky! In here he is at the peak of his matinée idol stardom!And Eleanor Powell. Her acting is good and she surprisingly is GREAT in her Mlle. Arlette imitation. But the dancing! It's out of this world!!! I think is the best dancer in movie history along with Fred Astaire. You have-have-HAVE to see her in the finale! Her timing and everything is so perfect, it's almost unreal! B.M. of 1936 is definitely one of her best vehicles, because she comes across as very talented, sweet, and likable.The musical numbers, as I've said before, are extremely dynamic. Why? Because of the music and everything else. It took a lot of work, people, and time to produce the #s and it was not in vain, because all the numbers are spectacular. The key thing is the music. I's so good!!!!! All the songs are either toe-tapping or sweet and elegant ballads. One of the best Freed/Brown movie scores. The sets play a big part, too. Unlike a bunch of musicals from this period, the sets are not over-decorated and unbelievably lavish. No, they are simple, streamlined, very elegant, and art-deco. Because of these great sets, the actors' performances were displayed to the best extent they could be. Here's a list of the musical numbers: Broadway Melody: Sung in the very beginning by Harry Stockwell.You Are My Lucky Star: Sung after Broadway Melody by Frances Langford.I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin': The 1st big number here and my favorite musical number ever! Robert Taylor and June Knight are terrific together and look great. I think this # is an ultimate example of old-Hollywood glamor with the art-deco night club set, and the glitzy costumes and atmosphere. June Knight is definitely not the world's greatest dancer but her singing is great. Robert Taylor pulls off his number well with a nice singing voice. The whole thing is extremely romantic and elegant. To me, ""Foolin'"" is unforgettable.Sing Before Breakfast: Buddy and Vilma Ebsen tap dance to this in the beginning. Later, Eleanor taps. It's the start of her career at MGM and a mere shadow of what was yet to come. This # is fun and adorable.I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin: Reprised nicely at a rehearsal by Frances Langford.You Are My Luck Star: Another big # and enchanting! I am sure everybody will like this lavish ballet but I think it's a tad bit not as good as the other #'s for some reason I can't pinpoint. it's first sung by Eleanor (dubbed by Marjorie White) and then danced by Eleanor and a bunch of chorines.On a Sunday Afternoon: Another cute big-ish # by Buddy and Vilma. Their tapping is great. They're is in 1890's period costume for this.A Cappella Tap: Eleanor does an a cappella tap #! She is truly amazing in this while in Arlette guise.Broadway Rhythm: The glorious finale! You have to see this! The costumes and the set and acts are just wow!!!!!! And that MUSIC is absolutely soul-searing!!!!! And when Eleanor comes out for the end, she does one of her best tap solos ever! I can hardly describe this, just see the number and you'll love it!

tt0026144,One of the glitziest musicals ever produced.,8.0,"The songs in this film are classics. ""Dream of You"", ""Lucky Star"" are just two of the best every written. The choreography is what you learn to expect from the likes of Eleanor Powell, Buddy Ebsen and Nick Lang. And you get a rare chance to glimpse the talents of Vilma Ebsen, Buddy's sister. (One of the few negatives of the film is Vilma's lack of acting ability. But this is a very small distraction.)Robert Taylor is his silky smooth self. Normally easy to dislike in other films, his character (the producer) comes off as likable and honest.If you are an Una Merkel fan, as I am, she would be reason enough to spend the time watching this picture. She is her adorable self, as Taylor's secretary.Powell shows up as an ex girl friend from Albany, with stars in her eyes, looking for a break in show business, only to be turned away by Taylor, who honestly believes Broadway is no place for this innocent. Eleanor has a tough time emoting with the veteran actors here, and her shallow acting talent can be a little grating at times. But her dancing and off beat beauty far over ride any real distractions.Jack Benny has a chance to display an edgier side; one which we are not used to seeing from him, and it both surprising and gratifying to see how well he carried it off.This is one of those films you can dust off and watch any time you're feeling the need for a shot of simpler, easier times.",14,15,False
tt0026144,Eleanor Powell bursts into stardom as a great dancer...,6.0,"Although this is clearly a showcase for the talented dynamo ELEANOR POWELL, MGM's forerunner to the tap-dancing Ann Miller, Broadway MELODY OF 1936 has some painfully clumsy musical moments that are mercifully offset by some brilliant dance routines by Powell. You have to take the good with the bad, and thankfully, the best moments are worth watching.Worst of the lot, is the tenement roof dance ""Sing Before Breakfast"" sung by Buddy and Velma Ebsen while Powell does the dance steps, possibly the clumsiest musical moment in the whole film with an uninspired song to boot. But when Powell is daydreaming to ""You Are My Lucky Star"" her dancing reaches the zenith of her particular appeal as a performer. Lots of other musical moments are equally worthwhile, but as said before, there are some poorly staged moments too.In fact, the whole story is an uneven blend of music and dance with a thin story serving as a mere excuse to introduce each new number. JACK BENNY, as a gossip columnist, and PHIL SILVERS, as ""Snoop"", his sidekick, have some funny moments in early screen appearances, and MGM's matinée idol ROBERT TAYLOR gets to sing a ditty or two in a pleasing enough fashion. Powell was always dubbed for her singing, in this case by Frances Langford.It's not the best of the Broadway MELODY flicks, but has its moments of pure fun with the very talented Powell proving that she could even act a little between dance numbers.",8,11,False
tt0026144,"Lightweight, But Lots of 1930s Musical Charm",7.0,"The plot of Broadway MELODY OF 1936 is a classic of its kind. Bob Gordon (popular matinée idol Robert Taylor) is producing a Broadway musical--but he runs afoul of actress and financial backer Lilly Brent (June Knight), who sees herself not only as the star of the show but Bob's ladylove as well. When their ""romance"" is played up by gossip columnist Bert Keeler (Jack Benny) fireworks ensue, and matters are further complicated by the arrival of Bob's old flame Irene Foster (Eleanor Powell) who has come to make her fortune as a dancer on the Great White Way.The twists and turns of the story are fairly obvious and the outcome is a foregone conclusion--like many Hollywood musicals of the mid-1930s the story really exists as an excuse for comic turns and musical numbers--but the film has a great deal of charm and catches a host of performers moving up to stardom. The big news here is Eleanor Powell and Jack Benny, both fairly new to film and both somewhat stiff in front of the camera... but whatever their faults in this film there's no denying that Powell clearly poised to become a great musical star or that Benny is a comic genius in the making.Powell, Taylor, and Benny are backed by a truly solid host of character actors and cameo performers, most notably Sid Silvers, Una Merkle, Frances Langford, and Harry Stockwell. But most film buffs will be particularly interested in the brother-sister team of Buddy and Vilma Ebsen, a popular vaudeville act; Vilma would soon retire, but Buddy's scruffy look, dunderheaded comedy, and hilariously eccentric dance style would propel him to a series of popular musicals and a very long career indeed. The musical numbers--which include such perennials as ""Broadway Melody,"" ""You are My Lucky Star,"" and ""Gotta Feeling You're Fooling""--are all lots of fun to hear and see as well.When all is said and done, Broadway MELODY OF 1936 is hardly a ""classic musical;"" it is too disjointed, too cliché in plot and character to measure up to the truly great musicals of the era. But it is quite a bit of fun, and hardcore 1930s musical fans should enjoy it quite a bit.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7,10,False
tt0026144,Good Luck Staying Awake Through This One,2.0,"Despite its Oscar nomination for Best Original Story, the plot of ""Broadway Melody of 1936"" could fit on a toothpick. And what little there is moves forward at a glacial pace, completely stopped from time to time by a lavish musical number warbled out in supreme 1930s style.Though I prefer musicals post-""Oklahoma!"", when songs were integrated into the plot rather than existing as stand-alone numbers strung together by the thinnest of stories, I'm not resistant to the charms of these more antiquated examples of the genre. ""42nd Street,"" from a couple of years before this film, is one of the best movies of the 1930s, while a couple of the Astaire/Rogers films from the same decade are some of the best movies ever made, period. No, my problem is that ""Broadway Melody of 1936"" just isn't very good. It sits in that awkward place between stage vaudeville and movie musical, not completely one or the other, and not harnessing the best attributes of either. The humor is broad and tired -- a running gag about a snore expert wears out its welcome the moment it's introduced. Famous showman Buddy Ebsen has a small role that showcases his singing and dancing abilities, but he uses the opportunity to give one of the most bizarre performances captured on screen. I'm not sure whether his decision to deliver all of his lines as if he's just starting to feel the effects of swallowing a handful of sleeping pills was his choice or the director's, but it was the wrong choice in either case. The only asset the film has is Eleanor Powell, who's certainly no musical comedy legend, but does display some impressive hoofing, and gives the film the only jolt of energy it manages to muster in a tap dance routine she performs in a slinky black dress and without any musical accompaniment. The rest of the film is a bore that I had trouble staying awake for.Even with 12 Best Picture nominees in 1935, it is inexplicable that this film managed to snag a nomination for the big prize, when films like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"" were left off the list. The film's only real point of interest is the ""I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling"" number, which won film choreographer Dave Gould the inaugural Oscar for Best Dance Direction, a category that would only survive for three years before being abandoned by the Academy.Grade: D",2,9,False

But this plot is extra fun - Benny, as a columnist, creates a fake French star, La Belle Arlette (the name of his cigar) to tantalize Taylor, who can't find a lead for his new show. When Taylor's secretary finds Benny's assistant, played by Sid Silvers, sleeping in Arlette drag with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, she knows it's a hoax.

Taylor actually sings in this, and, like Jimmy Stewart, his voice is pleasant enough. Taylor is stunning, no doubt in the film for box office. Powell is fantastic - great dancing - not just tap but ballet - and her comedy is wonderful. Have to say I LOVED both her disguise and disguised persona.

tt0026144,A great treat!!!,9.0,"Why would anybody spend two hours watching a 77 year old movie? The short answer is ""because it's a lot of fun."" But there are other reasons. It is an interesting relic of the dirty thirties when 25 cents bought you a two hour escape from depression, dust, despair and dire news from Europe. Hollywood catered to this need with wildly happy, unrealistic schmaltz about glamorous people in fancy clothes dancing and singing at posh cabarets in exotic places. And it was great! Just as wars give us great songs, the depression gave us fabulous movies. To a student of either film or history, films such as this are a hugely interesting window on the era. Such films are also revealing lessons in production: staging, choreography, special effects and lighting. Remember this was before digital technology and less than ten years after the arrival of sound. And the lighting! Immaculate highlights and shadows, razor sharp detail. (Thanks to Turner Classic for presenting top quality prints of these old films. I doubt if the theatre audiences of 1935 saw it as well as I did at home on my plasma TV.) Thankfully the trend to colourize these old films was thwarted. The beautiful B&W photography only adds to the fascination. It made for a memorable evening!",8,8,False
tt0026144,"While I am not a huge fan of this style of musicals, this one really delivers",8.0,"Although I have reviewed a ton of movies on IMDb, very few of them have been musicals since I am not a big fan of the genre. However, on a whim, I decided to watch this film and was surprised to find that it was a very pleasant romp--though the casting was often quite strange. The two strangest parts were played by Jack Benny and Robert Taylor. Both actors were still in search of personas at this point in their careers and so it's not surprising they both played against their later types. As for Benny, instead of playing the lovable cheapskate with the patented ""Benny"" reaction to problems, he played a fast-talking muck-raking journalist who had no problem lying or twisting facts to get a good story. However, the oddest casting probably was Taylor, as he played a big-shot Broadway producer AND he was required to sing twice in the film!!! Considering that Taylor was never known for his singing ability, his songs were not that bad--they were passable songs in spite of his weak voice.I think that a lot of the reason Taylor was able to carry this off was because of the excellent songs written for the film. The words and melodies were quite catchy and even bizarre singers like Buddy Ebsen were able to carry it off. As for Ebsen, his unusually stylized dancing (sort of like ""dorky dancing"") worked well and it was interesting to see him dancing with his sister, as they had been a dance team on stage before going to Hollywood. It was strange that in spite of the pleasantness of their teaming in this picture that it turned out to be Vilma Ebsen's only film, while Buddy went on to a lengthy Hollywood career. I particularly liked the song and dance number they did called ""Sing Before Breakfast"".Now as far as Eleanor Powell goes, this film was right up her alley, so to speak, as it gave her perhaps her best chance to show off her dancing. While IMDb indicates she might have had her singing dubbed (and there's no way to confirm this), her dancing was just amazing--so much so that I just sat amazed watching her incredibly fast tap dancing. In fact, the great Fred Astaire probably could NOT have kept up with her--she was that fast on her feet. I'm sure Astaire fans out there might doubt this but I really encourage them to watch Ms. Powell closely to see what I mean. Also, another interesting aspect of her performance was her brief impersonation of Katherine Hepburn from MORNING GLORY--it was dead on in manner and voice.So, the film has a pretty good story (though a bit formulaic), excellent acting and enjoyable songs--it's starting to sound almost perfect. Well, while it IS a very good film, there was one odd and annoying recurring character--the professor that did snoring imitations. He just didn't fit in to the film and if he was supposed to be comic relief, he certainly was not! The best comic relief was provided by Sid Silvers as Jack Benny's assistant. In many ways he looked like a combination of Alan Jenkins and Jules Dassin (I know this is a pretty obscure film reference) and was quite good in this role.",5,7,True

tt0026144,"Benny and Taylor duel, Langford sings, Powell and Knight dance,",9.0,"Thr first of 3 films of the late '30s that featured the dancing of Eleanor Powell among other things, and were modeled on the '29 film Broadway Melody.Nearly all the musical numbers were composed by the team of Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, and included the most memorable group of songs in this series of films. In contrast to the subsequent 2 films, Eleanor was not given a male dancing partner for any of her numbers, except when dancing with the Ebsen brother-sister team. There are essentially 3 big production number. Eleanor, along with a dance troupe, is featured in one, to the memorable ""You are my Lucky Star"", staged as a daydream by Eleanor, who is trying to convince her boyfriend, played by heartthrob Robert Taylor, to allow her the lead in his new play.This dream has two clearly divided parts. First, she sings(dubbed) alone before an audience. Then, she appears in a white wintery-looking ballet outfit while a male chorus continues the song. Eventually, she joins in a ballet troupe to do a twirling ballet number amid a wintery-looking stage setup that includes a reflecting pond. I thought this was a more visually pleasing number than the somewhat similar ballet number she did in the '40 film.Eleanor is not in the first big production number, which begins with Mae West-like June Knight singing to Robert Taylor ""I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling with Me"", which Taylor joins in at times.This is followed by a dance routine by Nick Long and a female dance troupe, in which Long includes some gymnastic stunts, such as jumping over a lineup of dancers, and a series of cartwheels.Long and June finish up with a romantic dance, after which June rejoins Taylor.The third big production serves as the finale, in which various stars, singly or in combination, are featured singing or dancing to the memorable ""Broadway Rhythm"". After cute Frances Langford, in glittering top hat and suit, sings this at length, Buddy and Vilma Ebsen do an eccentric dance, followed by a dance troupe,then another romantic dance by Long and June.Eleanor, in sparkling top hat and suit, finishes up with a lengthy tap dance and spins-dominated solo that finally convinces Taylor that she is ready to be his female lead and wife. The film begins with a brief rendition of ""Broadway Melody"" by Harry Stockwell, followed by a beautiful rendition of ""You are my Lucky Star"" by Francis Langford. Next, Jack Benny (as Bert Keeler) does a Walter Winchell radio broadcast impersonation. He will burlesque Walter Winchell's prominent position in radio and newspaper gossip and political commentary throughout the film, aided by his assistant Snoop(Sid Silvers). As such, he acts as a constant thorn in the side of Broadway producer Robert Gordon(Taylor) and his Mae West-like financial backer-romantic admirer Lillian Brent(June Knight).This leads to a running gag of Gordon rushing off to Keeler's office to beat him up, along with Snoop, for publishing the intimate details of his show personnel and plans. Lillian also wants to become the leading lady in Gordon's show, but Gordon is hesitant, as she is an unknown as an actress. Eleanor also wants this role, but is also an unknown. Thus, Gordon jumps at the news that famous French actress: Madame La Belle Arlette, is in town. Unfortunately, this actress is purely Keeler's invention. He keeps everyone guessing where she is, with Snoop masquerading as her unhelpful secretary. Eventually, Gordon's secretary(cute winsome Una Merkel) discovers the truth, and arranges for Eleanor to masquerade as the French actress as a means of getting her foot in the door as Gordon's leading lady.This episode provides Eleanor with the best opportunity in these 3 films to demonstrate her considerable talent as an actress, detached from her dancing persona.Her impersonation of Bill Robinson in ""Honolulu"" is another indication of her acting talent. A very fussy Madame receives a stage audition, is accepted, but Eleanor appears as herself in the show, so that Gordon can see her talent.I should mention Robert Wildhack, who appears several times as another running gag, with his inane snoring classification demonstration.Apparently audiences of the time were more amused by this act than most present day viewers. It gave them a chance to to laugh at the commonly perceived tendency of scientists to over intellectualize everything. He would return for the BM '38 film to do a similar demonstration of sneeze classification! Other returnees for the BM '38 would include Eleanor, Taylor and Buddy Ebsen, but not sister Vilma, who retired. In contrast to the present film, Eleanor would be given a romantic dance partner, George Murphy, in the '38 film, and both Murphy and Astaire in the '40 film. Her dancing much more dominates the '40 film, in the absence of other lead female dancers or singing without dancing. Personally, I have a slight preference for the '38 film. Eleanor made some other films during this period that featured her dancing. I recommend ""Honolulu"" because she does several specialized dances you won't see in other films, including jumping rope while tap dancing and doing spins, a blackface impersonation of Bill Robinson, and a modified hula.",4,4,True

I mean, it's fascinating to see Jed Clampett hoofing it up there like Gumby with tap shoes, but only as a curio. As one reviewer has noted, Ebsen delivers his lines as though he'd just hit 4 tabs of Ambien. His sister had a face for radio and her dancing didn't make me lament her early retirement.But the real disappointment is Eleanor Powell. Not her fault, but who put her in that smokin' hot outfit and then decided to drape her in a long coat so we don't get to see her legs when she's auditioning as Fifi LeBalle. Then in the big closing number they've got her in thick, long pants that belong on a back alley hobo. Maybe she was packing around a few extra pounds on those gorgeous legs because her costuming completely mystifies me. However, I will admit her spinning in that final dance is remarkable; I kept looking for figure skates. Good thing Powell could dance b/c she couldn't act. No amount of costuming could cover that up.Robert Taylor is the pretty-boy producer. Looks great in a suit. That's about it.This movie is little more than a hack of the great Busby Berkley musicals.

It kept me entertained from beginning to end and had a number of great songs -- including ""Broadway Melody"" and ""You Are My Lucky Star"" Unlike another reviewer (who wrote a darned good review), I actually think the plot here was substantial enough -- though perhaps not totally logical in the details -- to make sense.Jack Benny is excellent here as a newspaper man who writes a gossip column about Broadway. His column isn't exactly knocking them dead, so his editor orders him to get gritty, or else. And he does, focusing his wrath on Broadway producer Robert Taylor. Benny is very good here, though he plays a cynical role, unlike what we were used to in the later Benny of television. But, if you watch Benny movies like ""George Washington Slept Here"", you learn that Benny -- in some of his films -- could be sarcastic and a bit edgy. So for me, this was not a surprising character.Sid Silvers, an actor with whom I am not familiar, played a good second banana as Benny's assistant. It's not always funny when a male actor plays a female bit, but this one is.I wish I had read about this film before watching it, because I didn't realize that Buddy Ebsen's partner is this film was his real-life sister! They are hardly the greatest of hoofers. I always thought that Buddy Ebsen was a decent dancer with little discipline, and that came across in this film, too. But he lends a character to his films that usually makes sense, and that overshadows a less than great dancing talent.Una Merkel was a greatly underrated actress, and as with most of her film roles, she turns in a really enjoyable performance here.Robert Taylor seems cast out of character here, but of course, this was very early in his career. Though it was his 10th film, it was only his second year in the business. But, he handles himself well here, playing the part of the Broadway producer in a reasonable way.I kept wondering who that one female singer was. She was so good. Quite to my surprise, it was Frances Langford, with whom I was only familiar due to performances in Bob Hope's USO shows.And, while Eleanor Powell has turned in greater dance performances in later films, she is still great here. For me, the great female hoofer of all time.Production values in this film were extremely high for the time.

This is a very lively musical about the battle between a Broadway gossip columnist (Jack Benny) and a Broadway producer (Robert Taylor) and the young hopeful (Eleanor Powell in her first starring role) who gets caught in the middle - did you ever think that you would see an MGM musical in which Benny and Taylor went head to head? Boasting a lovely score by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, including the unforgettable ""You Are My Lucky Star"" - the sparkling cast that also includes Sid Silver (co-author of the screenplay), June Knight, and Nick Long, Jr., who is such a terrific dancer and the ineffable Buddy Ebsen, who was bounced out of film and the public eye for that matter for twenty years by - you guessed it - an irate and irascible Louis B. Mayer. But Ebsen got the last laugh with two long running TV shows - ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Barnaby Jones"" after Mayer was long dead. Now back to the film. It is just full of great songs such as ""You Are My Lucky Star"", ""Broadway Melody"", ""I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'"", and""All I Do Is Dream Of You"", all written by the previously mentioned team of Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, but all but one being written in the mid 1930s, not the very early talkie era as you would believe if you watched ""Singin In the Rain"".

Buddy Ebsen is a charmer even early in his career, Jack Benny brings some great humour to his character and Una Merkel shows why she deserved to be better known. Robert Taylor is immensely charming and handsome, and acquits himself very well with the singing actually, while Eleanor Powell's dancing continues to be a revelation as well as her beauty and warm presence. We also have the pleasure of hearing young Frances Langford, who had a voice fairly similar to Judy Garland, singing for Powell. The film looks lovely too, shot with care with elegant production values, I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin' stands out in this regard. The score is lively and elegant, with fabulous songs particularly Broadway Rhythm, You're My Lucky Star and I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'. Choreographically, the dancing in Broadway Rhythm dazzles, one of Powell's best moments, while I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin' deserved its dance direction Oscar.

She took a back seat to NO one in this regard. I thought her acting was just fine for what she was asked to do, and I got a kick out of her Katherine Hepburn imitation and her French actress persona (she looked particularly beautiful when made up that way). Some of the comedy bits fell flat for me, such as the snorer and Sid Silver's shtick, but the rest of the cast (Taylor, Benny, Ebsen and his sister, etc.) acquitted themselves well.

tt0026144,Great Broadway melody,8.0,"""Broadway melody 36"" was great for many reasons. Jack Benny was hilarious as the reporter who was at first talking about nothing on the news radio except who's just had s baby. His boss yelled at him ""One more blessed event and you're done! From now on, I want you to pick up the kind of dirt on people that will get you socked in the nose!"" Benny retorts ""nice future I got."" Benny's boss: ""don't worry, soon as that happens, Ill give you a raise"". So Benny and his assistant Sid Silvers do just that and start finding dirt on Broadway show director Robert Taylor and his mistress June Knight and get it posted in the paper. Pretty soon, Benny's boss gets his wish. Taylor socks him three different times. I personally think that the way Benny flew back so far when Taylor hit him was a bit cartoonish, but I liked how Benny then said to Sid ""remind me to ask for that raise now"". The next great thing in this film is the beautiful, talented Eleanor Powell who wants to try out in Taylor's next show. Sadly to Powell, Taylor doesn't recognize her the first time he sees her (they were old college mates). But after pretty receptionist Una Merkel reminds Taylor of ""the goat sign"" that Powell told her that they shared years ago, he's then very anxious to recounsel with her. Powell then signs up for tryouts. I found quite amusing how when all the girls were lining up and as soon as it's Powell's turn, Taylor immediately takes her with him and Merkle then says to the remaining girls in line ""that'll be all for today, girls"". Next is a wonderful scene of Powell imagining herself singing (beatifully) to an audience ""You are my lucky star"". Then the second part of "" Lucky star"" with Powell and the stage girls all dancing beautifully. Pretty Francis Langford also sings her very nice rendition of ""You are my lucky star"" near the beginning of film. There's another great number with Taylor and Knight in ""I got a feeling you're foolin"". Powell and Taylor both want to respark their old college romance but further complications arise to not make it as easy as they'd wish.

I could've done with a couple less times of hearing (in a fake French accent) "" Madamoselle eez very very beezy rehairsing"". But most of this film was great.

All the characters in here are pretty interesting, particularly Cagney's boss played by Robert Armstrong.Watching this film, one discovers an interesting fact: government agents weren't allowed to use guns in the early days. That didn't change until things got totally out of control with too many defenseless lawmen getting killed.Margaret Lindsay also stars in this movie, and that's a good thing. The more I see of her, the more I like her. It would have been interesting to see what roles she'd play if she was a young actress in today's films.Finally, the action scenes in this film reminded me of the old television series, ""The Untouchables"" with the machine guns blazing out of those big, boxy 1930 automobiles.",34,36,False

Cagneys performance is one of his best, and it's not just cagney that shines, Robert Armstrong is brilliant as Cagney's tough talking FBI boss. and Regis Toomey's good but brief appearance as Cagney's doomed friend is equally pleasing.I love everything about this Movie, the guns, the Cars, the suits, the music. The only thing I don't like, is that every version you find of this great film these days has the annoying and rather pointless prologue added in 1949, showing a group of 'FBI Men' (or actors as I like to call them) having a training session where the instructor tells this fledgling officers that Gangsters are scum and and that law and order will prevail. WHY????????The 1930's were Warner Bros's glory days, and their gangster films were rightly regarded as the best crime movies ever (until supplanted by the brilliant Godfather movies). However, the new makes way for the old, and Pacino, De Niro, Brando, as good as they are, could NEVER replace the cockiness of Cagney, the ruthlessness of Raft,and the barbarity of Bogie(though sadly neither Bogart or Raft appear in this picture I'm afraid). Maybe that's where the film could have been better with Barton McClanes lacklustre performance as Cagney's gangster nemesis, being replaced by either George Raft or Humphrey Bogart.

He also entitled an upcoming film being made at Warner Brothers about the FBI.Though the FBI had been in existence since 1908, founded during the Theodore Roosevelt administration, it's structure and mystique never took shape until Calvin Coolidge's Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone appointed a young civil servant named J. Edgar Hoover as it's new head. The place was known as dumping ground for political hacks up to that time and Hoover put an end to it. He brought in the laboratories and fingerprint data base. Folks who had law and accounting degrees saw the FBI as a good career now. Crime was now national and a national organization was needed to fight it. Probably if J. Edgar Hoover had put in his retirement at the end of World War II his historic reputation would be a lot higher today. The negative stuff about him only comes during the McCarthy Era and beyond until his death in 1972. And only after that.If Hoover was nothing else, he was media conscious. One of filmdom's most notorious gangster actors went on the side of law and order for G-Men. James Cagney is a young lawyer who's not doing so good in private practice, wasting the education that an oldtime gangster helped finance. After his friend FBI agent Regis Toomey is killed, Cagney joins the FBI. His knowledge of the underworld is put to some good use though he has a lengthy time winning acceptance from his superior, Robert Armstrong.Lloyd Nolan makes his debut as an FBI agent here also. Later on during the Forties, Nolan played THE ideal conception of what J. Edgar Hoover had in mind for an agent in The House on 92nd Street and The Street With No Name.A couple of incidents fresh in the mind of the public were recreated for G-Men, the famous Kansas City Massacre and a shootout at a rural motel that involved Baby Face Nelson who escaped as chief hood Barton MacLane does here. No doubt these scenes lent a certain documentary authenticity to the film.G-Men dates very badly, the FBI is still respected, but not revered as it once was.

It was a watershed role for Cagney who had previously played the ""tough guy"" in various movies of the gangster genre. This movie finds him still playing a tough guy, but this time he is on the side of the law. Cagney is well-supported in his role with an excellent cast which includes Robert Armstrong playing Cagney's boss, Margaret Lindsay and Ann D'Vorak playing Cagney's love interests, Lloyd Nolan as an FBI agent, Barton McLean as one of the gangster mob which included ""public enemy number one"" (Danny Leggett) played capably by former Broadway star, Edward Pawley (he was the original ""Elmer Gantry"" in the 1928 Broadway play of the same name). According to Pawley, his role in G-Men was based upon the notorious real-life gangster, John Dillinger. This was Pawley's defining role as a ""bad guy"" in the movies, and it served him well in his future movies in which he primarily played the bad guy. He played ""bad guy"" roles not only in gangster films but also in horror, western, and comedy films as well. He once stated that he played so many ""bad guy"" roles during his 10-year stint in Hollywood that policemen often eyed him with suspicion whenever he walked down the street. They couldn't decide whether they had seen him in the movies on in the line-up! After deciding to leave Hollywood in 1942, he moved back to New York and replaced Edward G.

tt0026393,Among Cagney's very best,9.0,"I really like this movie from the early days of the Hays Code. In this early period of the Hays Office, the standards for movies were still moderately loose and quite a few movies in the 30s featured graphic scenes of violence that would not have been allowed just a few years later. But, as a nod to the Hays Office, instead of the film being a typical gangster film (which the office was trying to reduce or eliminate since they glorified criminals--but the violence level was still very high and this would not change for another couple years). These films, by and large, are pretty interesting and have so pretty sordid and fantastic scenes. Unlike the later Cagney films for Warner Brothers, this one had scenes such as a closeup of a lady being killed in a phone booth and cars flying off the road in a hail of bullets and exploding! This movie is DEFINITELY would you would call an ""Action Picture"" and the film is both fascinating and briskly paced.Jimmy Cagney plays a lawyer who hasn't got any clients. And, his friend from law school, a ""G-Man"" (an FBI agent), is murdered while in the line of duty. Cagney decides that since his life isn't going anywhere, he too will join the newly created FBI. But, in the early days of the Bureau, they have few enforcement powers and cannot legally carry guns. But, with a serious crime wave spreading throughout the country, the Congress grants them more powers and the right to bear arms. And, following this, the action definitely heats up--with battles involving shotguns, machine guns and .45s! Cagney grew up in the Bronx and actually knew many of the most wanted men who were all members of the same gang. With Cagney's bravery and resolve, the gang is eventually smashed and Jimmy gets the girl.While the story is fictional, the background information about the bureau and the way they conducted business had a strong degree of realism that was unusual for films at that time. Great action scenes combined with excellent acting make this one of the very best Warner films of the crime genre.By the way, the version I saw was from a 1949 re-release. It differed because it featured a very brief prologue praising the FBI before the actual film began.",13,16,True
tt0026393,More FBI propaganda than crime film,6.0,"Lawyer Brick Davis (James Cagney) is a fresh-out-of-school law graduate with no clients. When his old friend Eddie Buchanan (Regis Toomey) stops in town, he approaches Davis to become a 'G Man' - a member of a newly formed federal force that uses brains combined with brawn to make the perfect law enforcement. Davis isn't interested, but when Buchanan is shot dead by a gang of organised thugs, he joins up instantly, and begins to distance himself with his criminal clients. Upon arrival at the FBI recruitment centre, he knocks heads with his newly-appointed mentor Jeff McCord (Robert Armstrong) who dislikes the amount of law graduates they are getting. When the gang that Davis left behind start to cause mayhem on a federal scale, Davis uses his knowledge and experience to bring the gang to justice.With all the Pre-Code mayhem that was taking over the cinemas back in the 1930's, people began worrying about the flattering, anti-hero portrayals that the criminal underworld were getting. Films such as the 1932 version of Scarface, and The Public Enemy (also starring Cagney) both showed them in a flattering light, so G-Men wanted to make the law cool again. Cagney's Brick Davis is very much like the villains portrayed in these films - he's ambitious, tough, intelligent - but he's also moral. The criminals, however, are portrayed as pure scum, and (in a quite shocking scene) capable of killing women without thinking twice. More of an FBI propaganda film than a film noir or a crime film, but it's easily watchable.

tt0026393,Cagney as Good Guy,5.0,"Until this movie appeared in 1935, Jimmy Cagney had played roles in which he was a con man or a gangster of some sort. The formula having grown a little weary, Warners put him in ""G Men,"" in which he joins the FBI and pursues murderers and other people guilty of moral terpitude. Saw this for the first time tonight after having waited a good number of years and was satisfied but a little disappointed.What a cast -- Stu Erwin, Loyd Nolan, Robert Armstrong, Ann Dvorak (pronounced roughly ""Dvor-zhock"", like the composer, although her real name was McKim). Then there was Barton MacLane as a bad guy, Margaret Lindsay as a good girl. And the performances are about what you'd expect -- that is to say, pretty good, with the exception of Robert Armstrong of ""King Kong"" fame who would be better put to use as a traffic signal, only instead of ""go"", ""caution"", and ""stop,"" he could transmit ""surprise"", ""remorse,"" and ""anger."" Whatever happened to Ann Dvorak? She's unconventionally stunning, was a gay, sexy, recklessly clumsy dancer, had the biggest, most expressive eyes in the business, and -- as we all know -- the eyes are the windows of the hootchy cootchy.Lamentably, the story is a crazy quilt of barely related plots stapled together out of old scripts and recent newspaper clippings. It might have made a good comic book. You can pretty much tell from the moment they're introduced who's going to be toast. There's the personal animosity between Cagney and the gang he knows back home, some stuff that tries to capture the headlines of the early 1930s about Midwestern gangs, and a faux history of the FBI's reactive development. Scenes alternate between rather dull and talky, and speedy, unimaginatively staged ambuscades. I think the same car crashes through the same store window twice.I felt more nearly complete after having watched it. Cagney's performance alone makes it worth watching. He lacks some of his usual mannerisms, the shrug of the shoulders, the hitch of the pants, but he's bouncy and smart-alecky. It's only the narrative and the direction that seems lacking or leaden. I mean, after all, I waited about twenty years to see it, and I think the Warner Brothers owed me more than they delivered.",5,14,True

The other members of the cast do a normal job, just like William Keighley's direction. A supporting member of the cast that did a great job was Barton MacLane, as the villain.The movie sounds more like a propaganda to the FBI force, but this isn't a bad thing. For 1935's, the movie has great action scenes, with car chases, shooting, kidnapping, robbery, etc, and they are all very well filmed for its period.

He is visited one day by an old friend Eddie Buchanan (Regis Toomey) who encourages Brick to join the Department of Justice Bureau of Investigation (soon to be named the Federal Bureau of Investigation).When Eddie is murdered by gangster Collins (Barton MacLane), Brick decides to apply to the Department of Justice. It should be noted that in the FBI's early days they could only engage lawyers and accountants and were not permitted to carry firearms. Brick is assigned to tough laconic Jeff McCord (Robert Armstrong) who is of the opinion that Brick will never make an effective agent.McCord and Bureau Director Bruce Gregory (Addison Richards) both believe that to be effective, the bureau needs to have national jurisdiction, be allowed to carry weapons and hire law enforcers and not lawyers.As it turns out Brick was rescued from the street by gangster Mac McKay (William Harrigan) who took him in and provided him with his education. Brick soon demonstrates his capabilities and quickly gains the confidence of his superiors. Along the way he meets McCord's sister Kay (Margaret Lindsay) and the two fall in love. Bad girl Jean Morgan (Ann Dvorak) also has this thing for Brick.When Collins' gang disappears, Jean is brought in for questioning and we learn that she has married Collins after Mac closed his night club.

He remains his usual cocky fast talking self. Armstrong in a role that usually was played by Pat O'Brien, is effective as McCord. Of the female leads, Dvorak has the best role.

Once arriving in Washington for training, Brick is given a hard time by McCord, the officer in charge, but McCord thinks Brick has the makings of a great agent, even though McCord uncovers the fact that Brick's education was paid for by McKay, a racketeer, who now wants to get out of the rackets. Leggett, who was one of the people McKay sold his interests to, is now Public Enemy number one, following a mob shootout with the G-Men. The agency gets Congress to pass laws that allow the FBI to cross state lines, carry ammunition, make kidnapping and bank robbery federal crimes, and others to strengthen the agency. Leggett is captured and the FBI next goes after Collins, who is hiding out at McKay's hotel in Wisconsin. A shootout ensues, McKay and several of Collins' gang is killed, but the head gangster gets away. Can Brick and McCord apprehend Collins, before he kills his wife (a former flame of Brick and the person who gave away Collins' location to the police) and also kills McCord's sister, Kay (who Brick is sweet on)? Good film from Warner Bros. trying to sanitize Cagney's character from his earlier gangster pictures. Keighley's direction makes good use of all the shootouts which spare little and do paint a decent picture of the FBI's problems during its infancy. Cagney still manages to play the tough guy very well, even though this time he's on the side of law and order. Dvorak is sympathetic as Jean.

Even more surprising, the guy supports this decision, despite knowing that would make him and his associates a target. Such an odd relationship.The people behind the film sought the FBI's approval, particularly since they were fictionalizing real events. After the acceptance by J. Edgar Hoover, the partnership lead to the new beginning being tacked on in 1949 for the FBI's 25th anniversary. Today, the film is rarely (if ever) seen without the bonus segment.Because of its basis in real life, crime buffs will enjoy what they see and see it coming before the rest of the audience.

It may not be anything like what the real FBI was like in the 1930s (or 1920s, as the case may be). But it has Cagney being his punchy little self, this time on the side of the good guys.

Without checking his CV I'm guessing that this one of the the first Cagney titles to feature him on the 'right' side of the law though this is no surprise because like his colleagues at Warners, Bogie and Eddie Robinson, he had started in the theatre and was as versatile as the other two - I can't, alas, say the same for George Raft, a fourth 'hood' at the studio. One of the best things in G-Men is Ann Dvorak as the nightclub singer carrying a torch for the Cagney character whilst Margaret Lindsay gets lumbered with yet another thankless role albeit she does get Cagney in the end.

Cagney turns in another wonderful performance but to be fair, he rarely turns in anything but. The supporting cast are pretty good but there's no doubt this is Cagney's picture all the way.

All that changes when Toomey is gunned down.It turns out that a mob figure, who retires from crime, had put Cagney through school, and will die tragically as well as the film draws to a close.The acting is first rate especially by Cagney and Ann Dvorak as a flapper who marries a mob figure and will pay dearly for that by film's end. Margaret Lindsey, plays a love interest of Cagney, a nurse, who is the brother of Robert Armstrong, a G-Man, who at first has it in for Cagney, but comes to respect him.

tt0026393,same old Cagney - different side of the law,7.0,"In 1935 people paid to watch the physical, strutting, smart-mouthed James Cagney, and even in this film about FBI agents in the production code era of the 1930's Cagney gives them that. This time, though, Cagney is one of the guys trying to apprehend gangsters like Tom Powers of ""The Public Enemy"", rather than playing one.Cagney is Brick Davis, a guy who came up from the slums of New York, a man whose personal benefactor is in the rackets himself, but he never wanted anything for or from Brick other than for him to make good. The opening scene shows Cagney giving a legal summation - something about a poor man fighting the big corporations. As the camera pans back we see that there is no jury, and in fact Brick is getting nowhere with his law practice.An old friend, now a G-Man himself, visits Brick and suggests he join the FBI. After that old friend is shot in the line of duty by a gangster, Brick does just that. This film is pretty much a conventional, paint-by-numbers cops and robbers picture made exceptional by exceptional performers. Robert Armstrong, who comes across as more of a mug than Cagney, is supervising agent Jeff McCord who doesn't like Cagney from the start for really no good reason that I could surmise. Ann Dvorak is the ""tarnished angel"" - a chorus girl without a chorus who does what she has to do to survive but also wants to do the right thing and seems to harbor a bit of a thing for Cagney's character. Margaret Lindsay is Jeff's sister, a nurse no less, who doesn't like Brick either - at first. Then there are a host of bad guys the worst of which is Barton McLane in the kind of ""so mean he's terrific"" role at which he excelled in the 1930's and beyond.For people who love Cagney in action with lots of shoot outs and fighting an uphill battle to get the girl of his dreams, this one fits the bill.One thing that you may find puzzling if you watch the DVD release of this film, which is actually from a 1949 re-release, is the presence of a prologue. That prologue has Warner Brothers contract player David Brian playing an FBI instructor talking to a class of FBI men about the history of the agency and how it was before the agents could even carry guns. Apparently, the FBI offered no cooperation in the making of ""G Men"" in 1935, but by 1949 the agency really liked this picture and so this prologue was tacked on.

tt0026393,"The Top-Notch Predecessor to ""Public Enemies""",10.0,"Bad boy James Cagney went legit in ""Bullets or Ballots"" director William Keighley's ""G-Men,"" an exciting, 86-minute, black & white, crime melodrama about heroic F.B.I. agents waging America's war on crime in the early 1930s against notorious, cold-blooded gangsters. This gripping Warner Brothers picture represented ""Public Enemy"" star James Cagney's first foray as a good guy in a cops and robbers epic. The Production Code Administration and the Catholic Legion of Decency had finally clamped down on Hollywood studios and sought to curb excesses in sin, sex, and sensation. The censors deplored gangster pictures. They believed movies glamorized mobsters, and juvenile authorities feared impressionable children might sympathize with these hooligans. Consider the 1938 Cagney classic ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" as an example of the adulation with which juveniles treated a criminal who is scheduled to fry in the electric chair. Happily, swapping sides allowed Cagney as the hero in ""G-Men"" to triumph at fade-out and not die for his sins.""G-Men"" opens with a young attorney, Brick Davis (James Cagney of ""Sinner's Holiday""), struggling to earn a living. When a client finally walks in, Brick knocks him out the door into the hallway. This unfortunate ward politician had offered our protagonist a shady deal if he would work with him. No sooner has Brick thrashed him than another materializes. The second goon turns out to be Brick's old friend, Edward 'Eddie' Buchanan (Regis Toomey of ""Shadow of a Doubt""), and Eddie tries to recruit Brick for the F.B.I. Buchanan and he plan to get together after he nabs a mobster in town. Buchanan arrests the hood on a dark street after the mug leaves a meeting with three of the toughest thugs in town, Collins (Barton MacLane of ""Black Fury""), Danny Leggett (Edward Pawley of ""Thirteen Women""), and Duffee (Noel Madison of ""Manhattan Melodrama""), in an upstairs apartment. Collins spots Buchanan and uses Leggett's rifle to cut Buchanan down. Actually, you don't see Buchanan get hit by the bullet. All we see is the shadows of the two men and Buchanan's shadow takes the bullet. The Production Code prohibited scenes of law enforcement officials dying on-screen and the use of shadows proved to be an excellent way to circumvent this problem. A grief-stricken Brick sees Buchanan's casket off at the train station. Afterward, Brick completes the F.B.I. application and becomes a rookie Fed. Brick visits the man who raised him from the gutter and paid for his education. Although he is one of the biggest bootleggers in New York City, 'Mac' McKay (William Harrigan of ""The Invisible Man""), Mac has no problems with Brick's decision to join the Feds.In Washington, D.C., at F.B.I. Headquarters, Brick meets Agent Jeff McCord (Robert Armstrong of ""King Kong""), who is trying to persuade the F.B.I. Chief, Bruce J. Gregory (Addison Richards of ""Our Daily Bread""), to put him into the field against Collins instead of assigning him to train the new agents. Gregory needs new agents fast and McCord is the best. Initially, Brick and Jeff get off on the wrong foot. Matters aren't helped when Brick slugs Jeff in the right eye during a boxing exhibition. Agent Hugh Farrell (Lloyd Nolan in his cinematic debut) teaches Brick a form of martial arts called Japanese jujutsu. This represented one of the earliest examples of martial arts in American films. Later, on the gunnery range, Brick impresses McCord with his accurate marksmanship. When McCord inquires about Brick's sharpshooting skills, our hero informs him that he was ""marble-shooting champion"" when he was a kid. Anyway, Brick helps McCord out when it comes to apprehending Leggett, but Leggett later gets away in what constitutes a reenactment of the Kansas City massacre. The chief difference between this massacre and the real thing was that the criminal died, too. What is important is that Hugh Farrell dies, making it the second F.B.I. agent to bite the dust. Meanwhile, McCord learns that Brick has ties to organized crime and confronts him with the evidence, but he gives him a chance to defend himself. McCord had agents shadow Brick when he met Mac on a train passing through town. Mac has quit the rackets and invites Brick to visit him at the lodge. Brick explains the mentoring role that Mac played during his troubled youth. McCord tears the papers to shreds that he was going to use against Brick. By this time, Brick has had his first encounter with McCord's gorgeous sister, Kay (Margaret Lindsay of ""Baby Face""), who works as a hospital nurse. Naturally, Kay has no use of Brick.The censors were pleased with ""G-Men"" because it glorified the Feds rather than the gangsters. Shrewdly enough, Warner Brothers whitewashed one of the biggest F.B.I. blunders in the scene at the lodge that stands in for the real-life Little Bohemia raid that went awry. Most prints of this violent tale about bank robberies and kidnapping come with the 1949 introduction, but this prologue adds nothing in the long run except to commemorate Warner Brothers' shrewd thinking about producing a movie about the F.B.I before anybody else did. Mind you, J. Edgar Hoover saw to it that everything met with his approbation, and he relished the positive publicity that this super-charged saga delivered with machine guns, automatic pistols, revolvers, and shotguns blazing away. Clocking in at a lean 86 minutes, ""G-Men"" doesn't squander a single second in this snappy shoot'em up that chronicles the rise of the F.B.I. and the film reenacts at least one major crime, the Kansas City Massacre. The cast is first-rate and Keighley stages the action with panache. Basically, ""G-Men"" is the flip side of the 2009 crime movie ""Public Enemies.""

In real life, Cagney was a Master Tap Dancer, which is a very high honor for a tap dancer to achieve. The year G-Men was made, he played Bottom in Midsummer Night's Dream. He is famous for the grapefruit in the face routine. He was in all those gangster movies, playing the bad guy, but in G-Men he is actually on the good side of the law. This is a nice switch.I was hoping he would throw the guy in the wrestling scene (or whatever sport that was), but I did not see that happen.

tt0026393,G for good,7.0,"Of course Cagney's best parts in the 30's and 40's were his trademark gangster roles - think ""Public Enemy"", ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" and ""White Heat"" but here he gets to cross the road and do-good as a bored would-be lawyer turned hard-bitten FBI man in this brisk actioner on the trail of the gang who murder his best friend, who just happens to be an FBI man trying to recruit Cagney into the ranks! Obviously derived from a pulp fiction source (besides the above, the plot has still more twists and turns than a roller-coaster, it takes someone like Cagney to drive it along as you suspend disbelief at the fantastical coincidences that happen along the way. I quite liked the direction of the piece, remembering this is quite an early ""talkie"", for example there's a nice car chase montage, some nice fast - panning camera shots and a concentration on forensic techniques someway ahead of its time, all told in fact, the director keeps the pace up throughout, with some mild interjections of humour between the numerous shoot-ups which seem to occur every few minutes. There is some poor editing-in though, of some stunts early in the piece as Cagney goes through his physical training. The rest of the cast give mixed performances, the dancer that Cagney leaves behind (but who ends up dead as the unwilling moll of the villain who kills Cagney's mate - see what I mean about the fantastical plot-line) acts far better and seems a better catch than the straight-laced almost glum girl he actually does get! Also Cagney's old mobster-boss gets bumped off accidentally as the G-Men storm the gangsters' lair and before he expires, delivers an excruciatingly bad death-scene. To go on in this way would be slightly cruel as the film is clearly a star vehicle for Cagney and doesn't he know it. The version I watched incidentally has a late 1940's Warner Brothers introduction by actors playing real FBI men, effectively laying claim to the movie as a recruitment driver although interestingly the FBI isn't, to the best of my recollection, formally named in the whole film.",1,5,True

She is barely believable, though, as a poor girl masquerading as wealthy, via a sudden windfall of 5000 dollars. As for plot, you get the idea. Predictable to say the least.This is not the movie to prove Dee's acting ability, though.

Naturally she's excited and decides to move to New York and live it up! In essence she wants to live like a queen--even it only lasts for a month or so.

So I've decided to use a list to see some films I haven't gotten to yet.Frances Dee and Francis Lederer star in ""The Gay Deception"" from 1935. People would get another idea of this title were it made today. The beautiful, wide-eyed Mirabel (Dee) comes from a town where casaba melons are grown. She wants to let loose and live, but she has to make a living. Then she wins $5000 in a lottery.The bank tells her that at 4% interest, she can make $3.85 a week. Mirabel is not interested. She wants the money in cash and is determined to have a blast for as long as the money lasts.According to my research, despite admonitions by the bank manager, that would be quite a while. $5000 in 1935 buys $100,000 of goods and services today. With French hats costing $19.95 and hotel suites back them costing something like $32/day, Mirabel's money will go far even in NYC.Mirabel takes the Peach Blossom suite at the Walsdorf Astoria Hotel. She arrives with tons of luggage filled with gowns, hats, and furs. However, she is constantly hounded by a bellboy named Sandro (Lederer) who advises her on what to drink, what to order, and where to go, and she hates it and him.He drives her crazy, but she eventually has to admit to herself she's having a rotten time. She's alone, ignored by the famous society deb in the next suite, and there's a huge ball coming up, and she's not invited.Sandro promises that she will attend the ball, and with a prince.One of those light, sophisticated comedies that we won't see again, reminiscent of another favorite of mine, Cafe Metropole. Surprisingly, William Wyler directed, and it's a shame he didn't do more of this type of film.Both of the stars had interesting -- and long lives.In 1929, Francis Lederer made ""Pandora's Box"" in Germany starring Louise Brooks. He couldn't speak English, and she couldn't speak German. Fortunately it was silent. Here he is in 1935 speaking English impeccably and giving a marvelous performance.Irving Thalberg intended to make him a huge star, but with Thalberg's death, Lederer failed to make Clark Gable status. He worked until 1971 and then opened an acting school; the week of his death, at 100, he was still teaching.Frances Dee was pregnant with Jody McCrea with her husband Joel when this film was made; two more children followed, the last one in 1955. She stopped working in the '50s with no regrets. She was married to McCrea until his death in 1990.Some trivia: Selznick considered casting Dee as Melanie Wilkes, but backed off when he thought that her beauty might overshadow newcomer Vivien Leigh.

tt0026400,Wyler at His Best!,10.0,"It's great to have this little-known but riotously funny, big-budget gem now available on a superb Fox DVD. It's certainly not a typical vehicle for director William Wyler, but it's handled with such pace and crispness and such loving attention to detail, that anyone unfamiliar with Wyler's work would imagine that comedy was his particular specialty. Yet for the life of me, I can't think of a single other comedy he directed. Here, he has coaxed some wonderfully endearing performances from his players – particularly his none too promising (at least on paper) leads, Francis Lederer and Frances Dee. Their spirited and charmingly delightful work is brilliantly augmented by a first- rate support cast headed by the exquisite Benita Hume (looking absolutely radiant in an unsympathetic role), Ferdinand Gottschalk (as an amusing little busybody), Lennox Pawle (the pop-eyed consul), Richard Carle (Mr. Spitzer), Paul Hurst (a riot as the sarcastic bell captain), and way down the cast list's Robert Grieg (absolutely delicious as the pompous doorman who so expertly delivers with such perfect timing, one of the script's funniest lines). As noted above, director Wyler has handled the whole movie with a touch that is both sure and light. Joseph Valentine's sparkling photography is also a major asset. One of producer Jesse Lasky's best movies, it's a shame that ""The Gay Deception"" is not better known. Maybe the title is now the problem?",4,4,True
tt0026400,"THE GAY DECEPTION (William Wyler, 1935) ***",7.0,"This is the first of a 3-movie tribute (though I own a number of his other efforts that remain unwatched) which I will be undertaking on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of distinguished (if not a personal favorite) director Wyler's passing. Despite an unfortunate title – which, at this juncture, makes it sound like a biopic of Rock Hudson (or even John Travolta)! – this is an unassuming but nice addition to the spate of sophisticated/crazy romantic comedies to emerge during Hollywood's Golden Age (thematically, it recalls James Whale's equally delightful BY CANDLELIGHT {1934}). Wyler would display this kind of light touch only sporadically throughout his career (for the record, my viewing of its not-too-dissimilar predecessor THE GOOD FAIRY from the same year is upcoming), mainly losing himself in significant solemnity thereafter: while this may have won him numerous accolades over the years, it certainly did not endear him to critics who abided by the auteur theory! Anyway, the central casting here seems second-rate upon a preliminary glance but Frances Dee proves appealingly gauche along the way (as a small-town girl who, having won $5000 in a melon contest{!}, tries to pass herself off as a society woman while on a New York spending spree), whereas Francis Lederer is a revelation: best-known for playing sinister types (as in Jean Renoir's masterful THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID {1946} and the low-budget but inventive THE RETURN OF Dracula {1958}) or suave aristocratic seducers (notably Mitchell Leisen's sparkling MIDNIGHT {1939}), he retains the latter qualities here – in the role of the prince of a fictional Middle-European country posing as a hotel bell-boy! – but invests the character with quick-witted cunning and infectious charm.The scene is thus set for a multitude of complications: Dee is misguidedly feted by the hotel staff, though still shunned by the true elite (exemplified by Benita Hume – Ronald Colman's wife – and Alan Mowbray) who can spot her modest origins a mile off; Lederer's savoir faire attitude belies his assumed rank (and even lands him in trouble with his 'superiors': forever losing his job, he then has his country's N.Y. embassy pull the necessary strings in order to get him reinstated!), while also initially putting the ingenuous heroine ill-at-ease. The eccentric, child-like ambassador himself (DAVID COPPERFIELD {1935}'s Lennox Pawle) has his hands full trying to keep Lederer's ruse a secret from a couple of investors of dubious morals (Lionel Stander and Akim Tamiroff) – so that, when taking Dee to a ball under his real guise and ostensibly exposed as a fraud, having had to assemble his officious wardrobe from bits and pieces belonging to various people at the hotel (including ubiquitous character actors Luis Alberni and Robert Greig), Pawle cannot vouch for the prince, and the latter is thus thrown in jail! An earnest Dee tries to intervene, believing Lederer had done this grand gesture for her sakebut, upon being revealed for what he really is, she feels used by him and flees in humiliation, intent on going back home. The inevitable last-scene reconciliation, then, is brought on by the simple (i.e. idealized) act of having the hero sneak into the leading lady's room dressed-up once again in a bell-boy's uniform!",4,4,False
tt0026400,"Minor Lubitsch, I mean, Wyler",7.0,"Try to tell me Wyler wasn't inspired by Ernst Lubitsch. Go on, say it. If this had starred Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald instead of Francis Lederer and Frances Dee, it'd easily pass for one of Lubitsch's films of the Pre-Code era. It's the story of a suave, European womanizer who falls in love with a largely unassuming American woman with touches of farcical mistaken identity on top. That it doesn't entertain quite as much as The Good Fairy is unfortunate, but The Good Fairy was just great. The Gay Deception is a lighter, less emotionally satisfying confection, but still a small delight of a film that resembles Lubitsch's So This is Paris.Mirabel Miller (Dee) is a worker bee at a small firm in Greenville, NY with dreams of saving up her money for a fashionable hat, a symbol of living large and having a good time (it was the Depression, so this is obviously wish-fulfillment for the audience pretty much from the get go). She wins a lottery of $5,000 and decides that she's going to go to New York City to spend it all and enjoy herself, even if only for a month. So, she shows up at the Walsdorf Plaza with management thinking that she's some kind of melon magnate's daughter. One of the employees of the hotel is a bellboy named Sandro (Lederer). He's unconcerned with the rules of punctuality and happily backtalks to his superior regularly. He shows up in rooms being made up and just asks to watch the process of making the bed. He's an odd duck, and the talk of the hotel staff.When Mirabel shows up to the Plaza, Sandro is one of the bellboys assigned to help take her things up to her room, and he continues his pattern of insubordination by sticking around, gently ribbing her when he watches her bouncing on her bed, and criticizing the style of her expensive $20 hat, all in front of a superior who cheerfully fires him in the elevator down.Sandro's secret, though, is that he's actually Prince Alessandro of the country Alessandro. The Consul-General Semanek (Lennox Pawle) is convinced that the Prince is on a trans-Atlantic ship at that moment, due to dock in a couple of days, and he's in with some nefarious gangster characters for...some reason. I guess it got explained in one line of dialogue, but it's really just an excuse for Semanek to feel panic at Alessandro's not being on the ship. His life is somehow tied up in it. It's enough for the situation, but it's still thin. Alessandro snuck over early, though, because he has some inclination to get into the hotel business, and he had decided to use the Walsdorf Plaza as an example to learn the business. Sure, why not?The meat of it, though, is the burgeoning relationship between Alessandra, continuing his façade as a working man by getting new jobs at the hotel every time he gets fired (he gets fired a few times to increasingly comic results), and Mirabel who is both attracted to and annoyed by this foreign guy who keeps trying to order for her (like telling her to order a martini when he's a waiter, she insists on something sweet, he brings her a martini despite her protestations, she enjoys the drink, and he smiles because he won). When he gets fired for the final time, he takes her out to dinner at a small Italian restaurant where he gets seen by the two toughs running Semanek, and Semanek sends some people down there to pick him up, to try and mask his identity, forcing Alessandro to abandon Mirabel at the restaurant.The finale of the film is around a large society dinner at the hotel, run by a snooty lady that revels at the opportunity to invite Mirabel but also insult her because she's obviously not of her class. Alessandro sees through it, and he offers himself in his true identity up as her guest. She resists because he hurt her, and she also doesn't believe him. What makes this whole thing entertaining is a ticking clock element (Semanek and the two toughs are coming to investigate the rumor of Alessandro in New York before the boat) along with the fact that Alessandro snuck in, stealing bits of clothing from other guests in the laundry, to make his entrance.It's all light and airy and amusing as it plays out. There's just enough character built into it around Mirabel and Alessandro so that their romance feels believable. The minor characters are broadly drawn and fun to watch, especially Pawle as Semanek in his most fearful moments when his hair gets crazed. Lederer is charming as Alessandro, fun to watch as he floats through almost every scene and situation. Dee is fine as Mirabel, pretty much the straight man of the comedic series of setups.The characters are perhaps too thin for any real emotional connection, and the comic situations are occasionally too contrived to really hit either. However, as a whole, the film is a light treat of comedy from William Wyler in the early days of the Hays Code.",0,1,False
tt0026400,It's a grand hotel with gaiety and laughter galore,8.0,"""The Gay Deception"" is a very funny comedy romance that is set mostly in New York City. Most of the comedy takes place in the luxurious hotel that is itself a humorous play on words. It's ""The Walsdorf-Plaza Hotel,"" (the spelling is correct, with the ""s"" in the name), which borrows its fictitious creation from the two prominent upscale hotels of the Big Apple (New York City) for much of the 20th century (The Waldorf Astoria and The Plaza). It's easy for the audience to miss this until one sees the hotel marquee when some of the characters arrive.The film has three sub-plots intermingled to create a story of a somewhat familiar theme of movies during Hollywood's golden era. A working man or woman meets a wealthy person of the opposite sex, with one or the other's background not known. Many films were made about rich heiresses running away from home (most of them were quite funny). And, there were some about a commoner falling for nobility (whose nobility isn't known at the time). Well, with a few different twists, the plot here makes an original story that is loaded with comedy, and a little romance toward the end.Frances Dee plays Mirabel Miller. She works in a secretarial pool for the Sunblest Seedless Casaba Melon Company of Greenville. She wins the grand prize in the Casaba County Sweepstakes. (Wherever the fictional Greenville and Casaba County are supposed to be located, they would be far from New York City. Casaba melons, native to the Middle East and far SW Asia, are grown commercially in the SW United States - Arizona, California and Texas.) Anyway, Mirabel just wants to spend her $5,000 prize on new clothes and living it up in New York City, as long as the money lasts.Czech-born actor Francis Lederer is an exuberant bellhop in the luxurious Walsdorf-Plaza. Well, at the start of the film, that is; and only after some time does the audience learn that he is really Prince Alessandro di Alessandria. He has come to New York in Cognito to see how the swanky American hotel operates. He is scheduled to arrive officially one month later, but even his New York Consul doesn't know of his under cover early arrival and job. The prince, Sandro, is known in the hotel as Number 14.His quest to learn about the hotel operation is because he plans to build such hotels to attract American tourists to his small European country. He recently became a member of the board of directors of a hotel chain that plans to contract with the Walsdorf-Plaza to build and operate their hotels. The company recommended that the hotel hire someone of its nationality as a good gesture. But, Sandro's exuberant personality and eagerness aren't quite fitting and proper for those of the service class, so he sometimes clashes with hotel management, shocks hotel patrons, and befuddles fellow workers. After being fired as a bellhop, he gets re-hired as a waiter. After being fired from that job, he gets re-hired as an elevator operator.Now, when Maribel checks into the swanky hotel, and the management thinks she is some sort of Queen of the Casabas, everyone thinks she's loaded with dough. That is, everyone but Sandro. And, although a small-town girl who's enamored by the luxury, Maribel tries to hide her naiveté. But, even her feigned snobbishness can't fool Sandro.Another subplot of this film has to do with two guys who come from the prince's home country and have made good in the States, perhaps with some shady deals. They are the president and secretary of the home country's brotherhood association in America. They pay the NY consul $5,000 for the privilege of being able to be in the greeting and celebrating party for the prince when he arrives. Lennox Pawle plays the consul-General, Akim Tamiroff plays Spellek, and Lionel Stander plays Gettel - the three of this subplot who add some comedy.Among the hotel staff and wealthy clientele who provide some laughs and smiles are Richard Carle, Ferdinand Gottschalk, Robert Greig, Benita Hume and Alan Mowbray.

However, through her many seductions, Ornella Muti finally makes him love her(enough that he marries her at the end).  It's really funny to see how Celentano tries to resist her seductive manners every time she tries.

tt0080439,Great film,10.0,"The main advantage of the film ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is an outstanding actor's play. Adriano Celentano was excellent in the role of lone farmer misogynist Elia. And Ornella Muti irresistibly played the role of Lizzie Silvestri, who wanted to win the heart of a brutal bachelor. Celentano created the incomparable image of a wayward man who does not understand humor. I really enjoyed it. I think Elia's role is one of the best roles of Celentano in his entire career. Ornella Muti brilliantly played the role of a liberated seducer too, but Adriano overacted her. By the way, thanks to the film ""The Taming of the Shrew"", the little-known actress Ornella has gained worldwide fame, she was invited to appear in foreign film projects.Also very funny original humor became a great plus of the movie ""The Taming of the Shrew"". The jokes in the movie are extremely funny. For example: Ornela appears in the evening dress as the queen of the ball. Andriano, with boundless astonishment, rises from his chair, approaches Ornella, bends down and raises a black beetle from the ground. ""You see, what a beautiful - this is a rare species of scaly-winged."" And he brings this beetle to Ornella's face, she was indignant and walked away.In conclusion, I want to recommend to all fans of excellent comedies to watch the film ""The Taming of the Shrew.""

tt0080439,Taming of the Shrewd,8.0,"OK, maybe a 8 is a bit too high (depends on your standards), but it was much better than I had a right to expect. First, unlike the other reviewers, I care not at all for Adriano Celentano, his music or his popular persona. So, what I like about the role he plays is that he makes fun of himself. At least I hope, for his sake, that he was making fun of himself and not playing himself in any way. The title, in Italian, is the masculine equivalent of ""The Taming of the Shrew"", and the story is more or less turning that play on its head. Maybe a little less, in that both the man and the woman play the object of the humor at various points, but the point being that the unconquerable (man) is, in the end, brought down by love. And Ornella Muti is, at this time, at the top of her game in every way. I couldn't help noticing that mole right in the middle of the bridge of her nose, though. Was it just for this film? The dialogue is great in Italian, and Celentano's deadpan delivery hits it just right, as does Muti's as a rich, spoiled Milanese man eater--I hope it translates OK.I have to say that the ending, with the very unrealistic basketball game, was cartoonish, and somewhat ruined the structured comedy, charming but rude, which preceded it.",5,7,True
tt1392190,On Par for Modern Hollywood Remakes (Meaning it Stinks),1.0,"First off, this is another movie in which the action sequences last so long that you can go to the bathroom, get a soda, come back and still find the same people fighting the same fights you saw begin 15 minutes earlier. Personally, these type of action movies bore me to tears, because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences. In terms of story, the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point. Then they fight, then one of them wins. As an audience member, I'm ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting. And I really need the lead characters to have some logical reasons for doing what they are doing. Here's my spoiler: They drive away from someplace for half the movie and then decide to turn around and go back. The only thing that happened was that they picked up a gang of old ladies. That's as deep as it gets right there. They're running away, fighting the whole way, they get away and then they decide to go back, so they have to fight the whole way. Nothing makes much sense, no characters are anything but as shallow as they could have possibly been made. If you like Avatar, you'll like this movie. If you liked Mad Max and Road Warrior, you're going to be angry about how that franchise was exploited in name and setting only. This character isn't Mad Max. He doesn't have a dog, he doesn't eat dog food, he doesn't eat anything. Nobody in the film ever eats anything. Nor are people clamoring for gasoline, they all just seem to have it. There's an issue with water, but it makes no sense and the entire weak plot seems to depend on it. The movie ends with giant water valves being opened just like the air valves on Mars get turned on in the end of that Governor Arnold movie, I can't remember the name. The reviews calling this something new and different are absolute hogwash. This is nothing but things blowing up and cars crashing for two hours, which, by the way, is another egregious offense of these silly movies. They take a 90 minute movie with a great story line, and they strip it of plot and somehow extend it by 30 minutes. It's a scary trend, the kind of thing that makes one think Idiocracy was prophetic. The less the story and the more things blow up, the higher the ratings. Ridiculous!",1065,2142,True
tt1392190,A masterpiece on a massive scale.,10.0,"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot.

tt1392190,An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,10.0,"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be.

He did well as Bane but he wasn't the star in this movie, almost like a support character. I almost fell asleep and left the theater because I can find better ways to waste my time. The only positive thing I can say is that the world looks great as well as the props. Good job on that George Miller. At least there's something good about it. The trailer was promising and since many people praised this movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time ""to indulge in the deep content and story it provides"". There was absolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictator who holds all the water and controls the people.

Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",568,1027,False
tt1392190,Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral,9.0,"Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history.",501,934,True

Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness.

Normally a good action movie should be entertaining and you Would leave the theater with a smile, but not here. Then in the middle, we have a lot of fire, shootings and blasts and a lot of stunt/animated scenes. But it does not have any power It's just the same over and over again.

tt1392190,What A Lovely Day!,,"The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",365,612,False
tt1392190,Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre,10.0,"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.",364,586,False

'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",385,567,False
tt1392190,A travesty of the original Mad Max movies,1.0,"I will be honest with readers. I only really watched the first 30 minutes of this Hollywood blockbuster. What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome. Honestly, once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film.",267,559,True
tt1392190,the world has gone mad,2.0,"It is almost hard too put into words how bad this movie was: The plot was virtually nonexistent , Most of the acting (bar Hardy and Theoren) was absolutely diabolical ,The script was like a ten year old wrote it, And Oh My God what was with that guy and the flaming guitar???Before you assume that I hate action films and that I am only giving this movie a bad review because I hate action films. Your wrong. Action is my favorite movie genre , and I was so excited to see this movie , but during the film I actually found myself checking my watch every five or ten minutes because it dragged on for so long , and for what ? Absolutely nothing.This is probably one of the worst action films I have ever seen in my entire life and I do not recommend it too anybody. The only really good thing about this movie was the visual effects , which where great.Final verdict : 3/10",242,507,True
tt1392190,"""My name is Max, My world is fire and blood.""",10.0,"'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. Papa want a sequel",256,487,False
tt1392190,Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,10.0,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it!

tt1392190,It Never Stops,5.0,"I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",255,445,False
tt1392190,I understand why you liked it but I hated it,1.0,"I hated this movie. I never got into the world or the characters. Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up. I don't generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme. In the end it was plot free, character free nonsense.But. I can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences. The visuals were stunning, the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling. Immerse yourself in the world and the action and I could understand this could reach 10 out of 10 proportions. I never got there and sadly hated every minute. Just a personal view.",204,418,False

Non-stop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe. This movie will have you feeling parched and gritty. Usually Not a fan of 3d - however, it works perfectly here. This movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it. if you love mutant vehicles, art cars, burning man, etc. you will be satisfied. A few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern Cadillac - the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me.",212,417,False
tt1392190,What a Lovely Day!,8.0,"Cold-blooded, botanically medieval, crusades-like, and horrifically thrilling—that's Fury Road. As for Max, it looks like he's the same archetypal Bane, only this time, he's more immune to ""I'm not afraid, I'm angry."" He's silent, and angry, and frustrated. He's Rango-like, reflective of the quest to solve the water-mystery. With everything red, orange, and yellow, it seems like you're viewing 300 blended in Saw, and over-the-top F&F.George Miller revises his ideological construct in the most exhilarating, dreadful, and striking manner this time. For all I know, the audiences spoil themselves with ""cinematic orgasms,"" if that's a thing, throughout the movie. They're not afraid of the porcupine-trucks, maybe a little on the edge of madness, but that goes without saying. Here's a hint as to what it was like: Bane and Miranda beating the beep out of war-painted, anti-Christian, Hulu tribe—only this time, it's some dark, full-raged action with mountain bikes, and trucks, and springy tentacles moving idiotic half-Willy, half-Wonka The Da Vinci Code Bettany's horrendous versions. Miller puts his tribal culture in the crux of action, which reveals an unorthodox, authoritarian, and devout portrayal of enmity. The sport-arena action is complemented by prayers in Citadel, banging of drums, skeleton-wheels, and skeleton-feels. It has a bizarre feeling—you're dredged into the modernity of Prometheus and antediluvian era of the Exodus.More than anything—Max's deafening seriousness, Furiosa's bald-grace, armless-attraction, sense of responsibility, and and absolute congeniality to the role (always imposingly remarkable,) religious affirmation, banging, puffing, booming, clatter, splash, tick-tick, boom—the ""fantasized-realism"" behind all the get-off-my-property-you-crazy-lunatic is what gives you the honesty-chills. The stunts, the effort, the don't-care-about-ourselves-just-love-the-movie-please pledge, and the extraordinarily enormous—480 hours of footage into 120 minutes of freaking-awesome warfare—blows me off of my seat in the cinema to the pale, scorching blaze of the sun, amidst the crazy-eyes of this action-genre Orange is the New Black. Even the over-editing has that medieval, darkly comical feel to it, just like 300 for example (can't think of another movie with such aberrant effects, but such positive response.) But like any other movie, there are points where you start questioning yourself. Nothing seems to justify Max & Furiosa's relationship, mutual combats, strategies, certainty of plans, and stuff like that. But by then, the movie's not about logic or sense anymore; it's more about seeing what you wouldn't in ages. With such a brilliant ensemble—I mean it was pretty good for a solely madness-based movie—you couldn't care less about the abacus-loving dumb-toads sitting in exactly the middle seats of the theater to get the most balanced view of the screen, and judge the minus-plus of the 120 minute long clip. I feel like reporting their stupidity to the CIA—enough with the pen and paper!Mad Max comes equitably with the characters, their roles, and the titular projections. Each name is qualified by its corresponding characteristic with the character in the movie—Spikers, Rictus Erectus et cetera. This complements the heartfelt glow to the movie itself—everything's done for the movie. They didn't feel any need to impose worldly sense into it, which is the best part, because that miniature world seemed pretty damn believable to me—but why? Maybe it were those religious beats, maybe the dragon-roars of engines, maybe it was just the psychological effect. Whatever it was, it did what it planned to.Mad Max: Fury Road puts forth the idea that there's so much more to combats than mere combats—MMFR incorporates belligerent, spoiling-for-a-fight attitude, oppressed landscape, estranged and barbaric drug-lords, heavy-weight weaponry and wheelers, and poster-paint bombings. The intensified red-blaze of fire, the sandstorm-effect, the preposterous turn of events, the nonsensical touch of things, and the wacky script—everything wrong with the movie is everything good about the movie. Mad Max: Fury Road revises the post-apocalyptic scene—utter dryness of region and minds—and uses the irritating sense of that dryness into a rigorous will to get past it with victory—Fury Road's victory. It's not about the comparative analysis of protagonists and the white-witty-wackos, it's about what's happening throughout. And when it happens, you're only remark is: ""What a lovely day.""",197,394,False
tt1392190,Very disappointing...,4.0,I was so amped for Mad Max after seeing the average review was high... WTF? Is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie was not good... No character arcs except for Nux and his was so contrived and abrupt that it shouldn't count... the basic story was very lame... the plot was goofy... all the 2D character villains with their bizarre mutations (the hovering baby-man? This movie had shades of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie... I'll investigate the user reviews here more closely next time so I don't get burned again... I still hope to see some awesome Furiosa cosplayers in the future so that adds a few stars.,189,389,True

This has to be the worst film I have seen this year and I was so looking forward to it. I have seen others call it a masterpiece or work or genius. I don't know what planet they are living on.. No real story and Tom Hardy who is a great actor only spoke about 25 lines in the whole movie. The actions scenes are great and the whole film is action scenes but we know nothing about the characters. Most of the film seems to be a rehash of the chase at the end of Mad Max 2 But with Mad max 2 there was a character build up.This is one film I will not be adding to my DVD collection If I had paid to see this I would be knocking down the door for a refund!!!",167,351,False

Seriously! #30 in the Top#250 !? Are you all kidding me?1 This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very very long time! I love action movies, so this is not coming from a ""The Notebook"" kind of guy, but seriously, there is nothing nothing good about this movie, it's borderline (if not full-on) ridiculous! A chained guy playing a flame throwing guitar?! Does it look cool? Yes, but in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be taken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever post-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to happen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50% of the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie, yeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie half-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What a stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and when they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again, not ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a movie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a storyline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline... what storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie, Silent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he survived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa (Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw Ruler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the bad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the movie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with them this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast milk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the semi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where they are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that somehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They tell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back to where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing them, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making they're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector, you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half.

Absolutely boring and unrelated to the earlier Mad Max movies.There is no reasoning behind the actions the characters are making.

tt0027698,What A Lovable Dinosaur,7.0,"Like some huge, lumbering, Paleozoic beast with a heart, nothing like this film has existed in a long time. And I doubt that there will be anything like it again. ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is a grandiose, three hour, B&W cinematic opus that chronicles the true story (more or less) of the professional life of legendary producer/showman ""Flo"" Ziegfeld, played convincingly by William Powell. It is an interesting, lovable film because it is so historically ... quaint.Structurally, the narrative takes a chronological approach. However, except for the film's starting year of 1893 and the ending soon after the 1929 stock market crash, no dates are given, a shortsighted flaw in the screenplay. But during this roughly forty-year period we see Ziggy's ambition unfurl into a successful career of producing some of the most extravagant musical shows in history. And throughout, the theme remains the same: to ""glorify the American girl"", that is to say to glorify the early twentieth century stereotyped image of the American girl.Despite his success as a showman, Ziggy was constantly plagued with financial problems, and embroiled in relations with women, the two most important being: the humorously indecisive Anna Held, and the lovely Billie Burke.More interesting to me than the biography is the lavish, grandiose production numbers. In the most grandiose of all, Dennis Morgan sings ""A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody"", as the camera ascends a slowly revolving spiral staircase adorned with ""Ziegfeld girls"" in outlandish costumes. The set, resembling a wedding cake, is about as tall as it is wide, with the stage curtain rising to what seems like stratospheric heights.The film's strengths are its humorous script, the dazzling sets, the glamorous costumes, the music, a cameo appearance by Fanny Brice, and a great tap dance routine by Ray Bolger. My main complaint is the film's length. Also, I find it curious that this big budget beast with its theme of wealth and beauty came out right in the middle of the Great Depression. MGM must have been on a colossal ego trip.Overall, ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is fun, and definitely worth watching, especially as a time capsule to an entertainment era that is gone forever.",58,68,False
tt0027698,Jeez Luise,10.0,"Before anybody goes on for one minute more about how brilliant Luise Rainer is as Anna Held, let's remember that she took the Oscar from Garbo's Camille. I mean, come on. Rainer is pretty and her instincts are right, and her famous ""telephone scene"" expertly employs the old smiling-through-tears device. But it's hardly as challenging a role as Marguerite, and Rainer's undeniable Continental charm can go only so far.The movie itself is a corker. William Anthony McGuire's screenplay is far above average for this musical-biography genre; it's full of smart wisecracks, and while it heavily fictionalizes Ziegfeld's life and persona (it makes him much more suave and irresistible than he was), it gets the big things right: his invention of the big musical revue, his obsession with glorifying the American girl, his unparalleled showmanship and eye for talent. Speaking of talent, you get a full, uninterrupted, great Ray Bolger number, several clever and lavish production numbers, and a snippet of Fanny Brice (but cutting away from her ""My Man"" is unforgivable). The actors playing Eddie Cantor and Will Rogers are amusingly terrible. And Virginia Bruce is memorably nasty as a temperamental showgirl.The Academy named this Best Picture of 1936.

One also gets to see Fanny Brice in a rare film appearance, and if you remember Barbara Streisand in Funny Girl you'll see how close Streisand got to perfectly imitating Brice.  Also, Ray Bolger does an incredible dance routine which shows off his talent to greater effect then his performance as the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz.  He's unbelievable. My only complaint, and this is about the DVD, is that Warner should have made the effort of restoring this amazing picture.

tt0027698,Ziegfeld: The Collossal Showman,10.0,"THE GREAT ZIEGFELD (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1936), directed by Robert Z. Leonard, and choreography by Seymour Felix, stars William Powell as the legendary Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. (1869-1932), in a fact-and-fiction musical biography that can be summed up from its opening credits, ""suggested by romances and events."" From the very start, with its very impressive theatrical lighted title credits lasting over two minutes, one would expect this to be a lavish scale production, and it is. So lavish that it leaves the impression the initials of MGM actually stands for Mighty Grand Musical, considering its great length of three solid hours (180 minutes), or two movies for the price of one. What an impression THE GREAT ZIEGFELD must have made in 1936, becoming an Academy Award as Best Picture for that year. Since the Ziegfeld name was still in recent memory, it assured box office appeal. The name of Anna Held (1873-1918) might be one for the history books. Because of Luise Rainer's carnation of this popular actress whose fame was the early part of the twentieth century, the Held name is most associated with Rainer than as the first Mrs. Ziegfeld.The plot traces the career of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. (William Powell), starting as a carnival barker at the 1893 Chicago Fair, his discovery and exploitation of Sandow, the Strong Man (Nat Pendleton); his departing for Europe where he competes with his best friend and rival, Jack Billings (Frank Morgan), for not only obtaining the services of his servant, Sidney (Ernest Cossart), but beating him to the punch by signing a popular French actress named Anna Held (Luise Rainer), to a performing contract with him back in America. To be sure he wouldn't lose his prize star, Ziegfeld marries her. During their somewhat stormy marriage, Florenz Ziegfeld stages extravagant shows that makes him world famous. Constantly surrounded by gorgeous show girls, Ziegfeld has his share of problems, especially with Audrey Dane (Virginia Bruce), a temperamental showgirl responsible for his divorce from Anna. Ziegfeld later meets and later marries Billie Burke (Myrna Loy), an accomplished actress in her own right, who not only bears his a daughter, Patricia (Jean Holland), but stands by him during his theatrical downfall and setback after the 1929 Stock Market Crash.On the musical program combining old and (new songs by Walter Donaldson and Harold Adamson), features: ""I Wish You'd Come and Play With Me,"" and ""It's Delightful to Be Married"" (both sung by Luise Rainer); ""If You Knew Susie"" (sung by Buddy Doyle imitating Eddie Cantor in black-face); ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"" by Irving Berlin (sung by Dennis Morgan/voice dubbed by Allan Jones); ""You Gotta Pull Strings"" (sung by chorus girls); ""She's a Follies Girl"" (sung and danced by Ray Bolger); ""You"" (sung by chorus); ""You Never Looked So Beautiful Before"" (sung by Virginia Bruce/chorus); ""Yiddle in the Fiddle"" by Irving Berlin; ""Queen of the Jungle"" and ""My Man"" by Channing Pollack and Maurice Yvaine (all sung by Fannie Brice); ""Look For the Silver Lining"" by Jerome Kern; and ""A Circus Must Be Different in a Ziegfeld Show"" (sung by chorus, performed by Harriet Hoctor), Montage score to Broadway shows: RIO RITA, WHOOPEE, THE THREE MUSKETEERS and SHOW BOAT (briefly playing ""Ol Man River"" on the soundtrack). ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody,"" an authentically reproduced eight minute musical segment is certainly the film's true highpoint.The ""granddaddy of all Hollywood's musical biographies, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD is a very impressive film with an impressive cast. While consisting of Ziegfeld headliners as Fannie Brice, Ray Bolger and Harriet Hoctor appearing as themselves, it also features A.A. Trimble and Buddy Doyle authentically duplicating Will Rogers and Eddie Cantor at best. This doesn't go without some regrets by not having the likes of W.C. Fields or Marilyn Miller recreating what they did best under Ziegfeld. Another letdown is having Fanny Brice singing her signature torch song, ""My Man,"" in incomplete form while the story moves to another scene. Rainer's role of Anna Held did win her an Academy Award as Best Actress for her performance based of her famous ""telephone scene"" congratulating ex-husband on his marriage to Billie Burke as she holds in her true emotions. While Billie Burke (1885-1970), then currently a well known film actress, could very well have portrayed herself Myrna Loy steps in for box office appeal. Frank Morgan, the fictional Billings, gives a performance worthy for Best Supporting Actor category while William Powell, the main focus from start to finish, was strangely overlooked by the academy.In 1978, there was another tribute to Florenz Ziegfeld, a TV movie titled ZIEGFELD: THE MAN AND HIS WOMEN, starring Paul Shenar as Ziggy, but it failed to live up to the expectations to the 1936 original. At 156 minutes, it seemed longer than the original. Unlike the Powell version, the 1978 bio-pic is pretty much forgotten. Unlike similar musical biographies of this nature made popular in the 1940s, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD captures the spirit of its time frame, with costumes and women's hairstyles being historically accurate. A movie at this extreme length tends to have its slow spots, which it does, but overall, a large scale production that only MGM can recreate. Distributed to home video by MGM/UA in the late 1980s, the roadshow version consisting of entrée and closing music, deleted scenes and intermission title has been inserted into the 2005 DVD release. THE GREAT ZIEGFELD can also be found on Turner Classic Movies, especially during its annual ""Thirty Days of Oscar."" (****)",30,34,False
tt0027698,Damn Good for a Film Biography of a Theatrical Giant,10.0,"I suspect that had Dashiell Hammett never written a successful comic pot boiler detective story called THE THIN MAN, William Powell's best remembered role would be as Florenz Ziegfeld in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. Here he captured that brilliant showman's vision and drive with just the right degree of sophistication. I can't think of few others - maybe Robert Montgomery, but I sadly doubt it (he seems too young) - who could have done as first rate a job.It is really rare for a theatrical presence to maintain himself or herself decades or centuries after their death. Prior to the invention of motion pictures it was impossible (except for the late 19th Century crowd, starting with Edwin Booth, Sir Henry Irving, and Ellen Terry - they had some phonograph recordings) for actors to preserve their personas. Photo stills helped but did not leave much. Occasionally one would ""accomplish"" something for good or ill that people would recall (i.e., John Wilkes Booth), but that was a rarity. Movies changed that by allowing the audience to stretch from the contemporaries to the future ones. There are actual movies of Flo Ziegfeld at work on Broadway. Unfortunately he did not look like Bill Powell (Flo was somewhat fat), but those surviving newsreels showed his energy with his casts and productions. Powell got that side of him right. THE GREAT ZIEGFELD traces the showman from his start as the publicity manager of Eugene Sandow (Nat Pendleton) from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 to his rise as a major Broadway impresario from 1900 until 1930. Only the Great Depression destroyed Ziegfeld's career (he lost most of his fortune in the crash). Significantly his fall is showed by the lights of his four currently big shows (including SHOWBOAT, RIO RITA, and THE THREE MUSKETEERS) all fading out one after another. It not only destroyed his career, but it helped kill the poor fellow (he died in 1932). But by that point his historical reputation was established by his series of spectacular Broadway ""Follies"" shows with the likes of Ed Wynn, Fanny Brice, W.C.Fields, Will Rogers, Bert Williams, Walter Catlett, Leon Erroll as the comic leads, and music by such composers as Jerome Kern, Victor Herbert, Irving Berlin, and even the Gershwins. But better was Ziegfeld's use of women - his ""Glorifying the American Girl"" reviews did precisely that, affecting taste in theater spectacles and taste in what beauty in women should be. He had his rivals as pointed out in other reviews here. Among them were the Shuberts, possibly the most successful in the long run (but only because there were several of them, and they did not go bankrupt). Earl Carroll did produce his ""Vanities"", and George White did do the ""Scandals"", but in retrospect (for all the talent they brought to their shows) these were pale imitations. In Carroll's case he skirted the level of decency by suggesting his chorus girls were naked in some of the sketches. Ziegfeld was no saint but he knew what was acceptable behavior in theatrical production on stage.This film had a good cast. Besides Powell, the women in his life (Anna Held, his chorus girl girlfriend, and Billie Burke) are played well by Louise Rainer, Virginia Bruce, and Powell's movie ""wife"" Myrna Loy. Rainer (as the betrayed Anna) got her first ""Oscar"" for this role, most likely for the emotional ""telephone"" scene. Her part is actually a substantial one, but due to the size of this film it has always been seen as a short supporting bit. This is a trifle unfair. Virginia Bruce brings a nice calculating eye to her performance, undermining the Ziegfeld - Held relationship, but slowly losing the showman due to her increasing alcoholism. Loy was really lucky. Once she got the role she contacted the living and active Billie Burke and had discussions about how to accurately portray the second Mrs. Ziegfeld. She wisely does not try to imitate Billie's familiar syrupy upper register voice. Frank Morgan appears as a friendly rival or Ziegfeld's, both in business and in the boudoir. One likes him as one usually likes Morgan's comic characters. My favorite performance is that of Fanny Brice playing herself. The film was made the year after the death of Will Rogers so that he was not around (he possibly could have been borrowed). Fields was out - Ziegfeld had had plenty of trouble with that curmudgeon on Broadway, and MGM probably knew that Fields would have demanded equal billing to Powell. Wynn was mostly still on Broadway. One does wish Catlett and Erroll might have been used. But we have Fanny in her glory, culminating in her singing her most famous number - ""My Man"". That alone is worth watching the film for. As for the showcase production number on the spiraling tower, it is quite impressive (I doubt if Ziegfeld could have put it on the stage of his New Amsterdam Theater), but I agree that the dubbing of Dennis Morgan's voice by Allan Jones is totally inexplicable to this day.",30,31,True
tt0027698,The Good & The Bad Of 'The Great Ziegfield',5.0,"I almost gave up on this three-hour film around the 45-minute mark because of Luise Ranier's shrill and annoying character, plus there hadn't been much in the way of music which is what I wanted in this film in the first lace.However, after the first hour the story picks up considerably with the music numbers and some nice-looking and interesting women. I liked Myrna Loy playing Billie Burke. In fact, I like Loy a lot more than Burke in everything! This was my first look at Fanny Price, who reminded me of a comic Barbra Streisand with her looks and Brooklyn accent.William Powell, playing Flo Ziegfeld, was, of course, the undisputed star of the film. He was terrific, too, start-to-finish. Powell had great screen presence and was a good choice for this role. Frank Morgan played his normal role with that stupid laugh of his, but he was good as Ziegfeld's generous friend. Another famous name of the day, Myrna Loy, gets good billing in here but not much of a role.Some of the sets on the Ziegfeld Follies are amazing Busby Berkely-type extravaganzas that certainly mark the 1920s and '30s. The line, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore"" certainly rings true. It's also true they look corny today, but they're still fascinating to watch. If I was older and had lived through some of this time period, I would really feel nostalgic watching this film, sad for an era long gone.",15,31,False
tt0027698,well-made flick that whitewashes the true Flo Ziegfeld,4.0,"Technically, this is a very well-made and slick movie. MGM certainly put a lot of energy into making this a top movie. However, the movie falls prey to what OFTEN happened with Hollywood bio-pics of the 1930s and 1940s--they don't let truth get into the way of a good story. The true story of Ziegfeld just doesn't come through in this picture--just a sanitized approximation of the man. This is alluded to somewhat in the movie, but the real life Ziegfeld was a rather selfish womanizer who left his poor wife with hardly a dime at his death. Billie Burke was the last Mrs. Ziegfeld and she returned to the stage due to these financial woes--hence, she probably never would have ended up in the Wizard of Oz or the Topper series if it wasn't out of necessity. It would have possibly been more interesting if the portrayal had focused on this aspect of him as well.",17,29,False
tt0027698,A Bang for your bucks.,,"Boy, is this movie long......but worth it for the most part. William Powell is, as usual, his urbane, sophisticated self in a romanticized portrayal of Florenz Ziegfeld. Myrna Loy,leaving behind her wisecracking Nora Charles persona, does a fair job as Billie Burke. Burke, whose movie career was based on dithering, silly women, was once a beauty who graced the Follies. Loy doesn't come across as either but she has never given a bad performance so she is believable. But Louise Rainer as Anna Held is the one to watch here. A beautiful doll-like creature, she enchants you with her performance. The famous telephone scene may be overrated somewhat but it worked for me....and obviously for the Academy...it garnered her an Oscar. The music is so wonderful and the ""Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"" with Dennis Morgan is eye candy. One glaring fault is that there is a very short sequence with the great Fanny Brice in which she is singing ""My Man"" ( probably one of the greatest torch songs of all times) and it is just cut-off in mid warble as the story goes on to another scene.

tt0027698,"Incredibly well made and entertaining, not without its flaws but well worth the look",8.0,"Knowing several people, on and outside of IMDb, who consider The Great Ziegfeld one of the weakest Best Picture winners, that didn't stop me from seeing it anyway. To me though, while it's not flawless and not the best film of the year it was still incredibly well-made and entertaining stuff and from personal view it is nowhere near one of the worst Best Picture winners.The Great Ziegfeld agreed is overlong with a draggy and at times uneventful first half and half an hour could easily have been trimmed. And more could have done with the relationship between Ziegfeld and Billie Burke which appeared late in the film and didn't feel developed enough, almost like an afterthought.However, The Great Ziegfeld is very lavishly mounted, with photography that's both beautiful and clever, sumptuous costume design and some of the most handsomely gorgeous sets of any 30s musical. Other pleasures are the marvellous and very well-staged(without being too overblown) songs with A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody being an absolute show-stopper, a script peppered with humour and heart and the mostly poignant story. Standout scenes were Fanny Brice's charming My Man, Ray Bolger's witty dancing to My Follies Girl, Luise Rainer's heart-breaking telephone(justifiably famous) and especially A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody with its clever photography and perhaps one of the best uses of a staircase in a film. The direction is adept and the performances are great, with William Powell suave personified and especially Luise Rainer who is the epitome of charm and grace, capable of a good range of emotions as seen in the telephone scene. Fanny Brice, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger are all memorable, while Myrna Loy is underused she's hardly wasted either.Overall, a well-made, entertaining and very good film and well worth the look. 8/10 Bethany Cox",25,25,False
tt0027698,Amazing Film,,"William Powell stars as Florenz Ziegfeld in his ""biography"" of the great Broadway producer. This is a lush and long film filled with great scenes and a few that are too long. Clocking in at about 3 hours, THE GREAT ZIEGFELD is one of MGM's biggest attempts at creating a blockbuster musical, and it won the Oscar for best film.Powell is, as always, terrific. Oddly he did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film but did get one the same year for MY MAN GODFREY. Luise Rainer won the best actress Oscar for her performance as Anna Held. Myrna Loy plays Billie Burke. The great Fanny Brice appears as herself and just about steals the show until they stupidly and abruptly cut away from her as she starts singing ""My Man."" She doesn't show up again.Ray Bolger gets a whole number to himself. And Dennis Morgan fronts the mammoth ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"" number (although it's the voice of Allan Jones), which ranks among the great production numbers of the era. The camera slowly pans up a seemingly endless spiral staircase filled with pretty girls as draperies are raised to expose more and more staircase. Then we finally reach the top with Virginia Bruce posed there. It's a giddy and spectacular sequence.The ballet sequence featuring Harriet Hoctor is rather a bore. I'd rather have seen more of Fanny Brice. Brice is hilarious in the dressing-room with blonde Esther Muir. Powell and Rainer are really excellent in this film. Notable co-stars include Frank Morgan, Joseph Cawthorn, Herman Bing, Marcelle Corday, Nat Pendleton, Grace Hayle, Ernest Cossart, William Demarest, and Reginald Owen.And while Brice appears as herself the Will Rogers and Eddie Cantor appearances are fakes. Virginia Bruce plays a character based on Lillian Lorraine, and Rosina Lawrence plays Marilyn Miller (here named Sally Manners).An excellent film in the old style and worth the 3 hours it takes to watch it.

There isn't a single scene that could be considered funny nowadays (and maybe even back then, too). Powell lacks charisma, and certainly isn't someone who can carry a movie of this ""size"". Accepting him as a womanizer is difficult; I don't know what the actual Ziegfeld looked like, but Powell couldn't charm an alley dog with that face of his. He's gotta be the ugliest leading man of that era. Rainer is totally over-the-top and too animated; her one-note acting gets tedious very quickly.

He had an eye for what worked on a stage. He was also the discoverer of a lot of the talent that went to have enormous careers of their own, long after they appeared in one of Mr. Ziegfeld's extravaganzas.Robert Z. Leonard in directing this film had a lot of contributors, no doubt, but it's probably Adrian, the costume designer par excellence that gave this movie a lot of class by recreating for the screen some of the costumes that were associated with Ziegfeld.William Powell portrays the great Ziegfeld. Mr. Powell is amazing in his interpretation of the creative man on the screen. He is this man he is playing on the screen; he is totally convincing he was born to play the role.Actually the film leaves a lot of things unexplained. We know that Anna Held is out of the picture, after her divorce, but nothing is mentioned that she had died at all. Also, the relationship with his second wife, Billie Burke, comes as an afterthought since she only appears in the last part of the movie.Luise Ranier made a compelling Anna Held, the French actress, who obviously never understood her husband, even though it's clear she loved him. She appears as a complete insecure person, never knowing what to do, or what to decide on. As far as the Oscar she won for playing this role, it eludes my comprehension, or maybe that year her competition must have been poor.Myrna Loy as Billie Burke gives a radiant performance. She was always a convincing actress and in the film she demonstrates her versatility in playing a musical comedy star. The young Myrna Loy was a gorgeous creature, as proven in this film.The costumes from some of the musical numbers are incredible. Of course, they were made to suit the theatricality of whatever Mr. Ziegfeld presented. Such extravagant numbers will never be presented on a Broadway stage ever again as the cost would be prohibitive.Virginia Bruce, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Fanny Brice appear in the film, but of course, the picture is dominated by William Powell from beginning to end.",18,23,False
tt0027698,A 3-Hour Sleeping Pill,2.0,"Oh my goodness what a boring film.""The Great Ziegfeld"" is one of the most dramatically inert movies I've ever seen. It tells the story of Florence Ziegfeld and the creation of the Ziegfeld Follies, but it feels more like an excuse to stage elaborate (and long) musical numbers that feature chorus girls posing in garish gowns. Watching these examples of the kinds of entertainment that were popular at the time, it's almost inconceivable to me that anyone would have wanted to pay money to see them.What drama there is in the film comes from the relationship between Ziegfeld and his put-upon wife, Anna Held, played by Luise Rainer. William Powell plays Ziegfeld like William Powell, and he's as easy to watch on screen as he always is, but if the film has any assets at all, it's Rainer. She does what she can to make something of her role and the movie, and it's a shame that her part is so small. She disappears for long stretches altogether. Myrna Loy, top billed but not showing up until there's only about 30 minutes left in the movie, makes absolutely no attempt to look or sound like Billie Burke, Ziegfeld's second wife. This one is a struggle to get through -- the film is so lacking in any forward momentum I was afraid at times that it would just grind to a halt completely.This terrible film managed to be named Best Picture at the 1936 Academy Awards. It's surely one of the worst films to ever win the top prize. It also scored a Best Actress award for Rainer, who I guess deserved it for giving the audience something, anything, interesting to watch. Its third Oscar went to Seymour Felix, who provided the choreography for the ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"" number, an interminable, vertigo-inducing one that features a bunch of elaborately-costumed women spinning around on a giant cake.

tt0027698,The Film's Calling Card Is Likely Its Only Real Weakness.,,"Extravagent epic that lasts nearly three hours and has always been praised more for its lavish dance musical sequences (which are the biggest minuses of the film to me) than its truly engrossing story. Florenz Ziegfeld (William Powell) was struggling in the early-1890s as his circus stage shows were becoming stale and down-right dull. Fast-forward a few years and Ziegfeld is slowly beginning to create the Broadway we think about today. Loud and vibrant shows come about and with them come much success, loads of money and many beautiful women (including two wives, Oscar-winner Luise Rainer and a young Myrna Loy). Ziegfeld also discovers many who would become stars. Ray Bolger, Harriet Hoctor and Fanny Brice all play themselves and the ways they were originally discovered are given some air-time. The producer though does age terribly and seems out-of-place when not working on shows. The stock market crash of 1929 would be the fatal blow in the life of an intensely interesting man. ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is a Hollywood product all the way. Director Robert Z. Leonard (Oscar-nominated) almost destroys the movie with overkill. The production numbers are interminable with some going well over 10 or 12 minutes. The shows, which are large, colorful and happy, underplay a life that was somewhat sad in many ways. Ziegfeld was not good with money (many times having to borrow from people like Jack Billings, played by the memorable Frank Morgan) and was simply terrible when dealing with women. Ziegfeld did create the image of the ""American girl"", but in reality he knew little of the opposite sex and treated women as little more than play-things or property than actual human beings. ""The Great Ziegfeld"" is a film that has a scale that rivals later cinematic triumphs like ""Gone With the Wind"", but this is not necessarily a good thing as the interest wavers on several occasions here. Overall a good film and worth a look. Pay more attention to the story than the production numbers though. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",11,22,False
tt0027698,Bad,4.0,"This is a real bomb. It is long and dull and would have benefited from some film hitting the cutting room floor. The ""sub-plot"" of the young girl who wants to marry Flo and who subsequently and embarrassingly shows up in his office could have been sacrificed. And the awful sequence in which Fanny Brice is backgrounded by a group of intentionally ugly women is insulting to all. And to cut away from Brice's ""My Man""! But what is left in is also bad. Powell always needed someone to play off and Myrna Loy's half-closed eyes and skeptically pursed mouth were perfect. Here she is just the recipient of honeyed words we've heard before from the unctuous Flo. And the big number, ""A Pretty Girl..."" is cringingly bad. It takes place in a giant scoop of whipped cream in which the pretty girls look like raisins (none of the enticing MGM closeups in this sequence). Worse, Berlin's ballad (hardly his best compared to ""Let's Face the Music..."") is interspersed with Dvorak, Rossini, and, unforgivably, Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue."" The latter is hardly a great piece of music, but it does not blend with Berlin's clichés. There was talent around in the 30s -- Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby (not that any was available for this film) -- but you'd never know it from ""Great Ziegfeld."" Rainer's impersonation of Anna Held would never convince anyone to bring her out of the chorus. Ray Bolger does provide a pretty good solo routine. And, given Ziegfeld's long career, plenty of good songs were available. Very few make it into this flick. Unlike a lot of 30s musicals with directors who knew how to film music and dance (Hermes Pan, Busby Berkeley), this one does not age well.

It does present a believable and entertaining look at Ziegfeld's shows and personality, along with some good scenes and some good performances that keep it going.William Powell was a pretty good choice to play Ziegfeld, since he has the knack of making a character eccentric and distinctive without having it come across as too forced or unnatural.  And Myrna Loy is always a charming co-star, for Powell or anyone else.  Yet it is Luise Rainer who delivers by far the most memorable performance - she makes her character temperamental but endearing, unpredictable but completely sympathetic.  The best parts of the movie come when she is a big part of the action, and when her character slips into the background in the second half, the movie loses something. The rest of the large cast does get some good moments, and it's fun to see a couple of performers playing themselves, although some of them don't get nearly enough to do.  The many production numbers contain some very good ones, but there are others that aren't worth the amount of time they were given, and that could have been cut down considerably without losing anything.You can see why this impressed a lot of viewers in its time, and it's still pretty good entertainment.

tt0027698,"""Needs more steps""",7.0,"It's hard to think of today, what with the theatre being a highbrow and typically minimalist medium, but back in the days before movies became big business, stage productions often presented the public with phenomenal displays of grandeur. In the early years of the twentieth century, Florenz Ziegfeld was a theatrical showman who had Busby Berkely's worship of feminine beauty and Cecil B. DeMille's sense of scale. He was creating Hollywood-style extravagance back when Hollywood was just a patch of scrubland.Fast-forward to 1936, a couple of years after Ziegfeld's death, and cinema still bears his mark. Musicals (which were still often based around stage performances) were often showcases for a variety of dancing and singing talents, usually building to a spectacular finale. The Great Ziegfeld is more than just a biopic, it is the culmination of this strand in cinema; the first epic musical. Here we see the 30's musical's shimmering sets and full-on dance routines on a scale never before seen on the screen. Robert Z. Leonard directs with his usual sweeping camera moves, often slowly pulling back to reveal the size of the production. But he also lets his camera get deeply involved in the more dramatic scenes.Apart from the various song-and-dance people involved, the casting here is very much a Hollywood affair. William Powell was then the go-to man for such smart and witty types. He and Myrna Loy were well-known as a screen couple, from The Thin Man pictures amongst others. They both give adequate portrayals, but in truth these two need a smaller, more intimate production to shine in their own right. The performance that best fits the size of The Great Ziegfeld is that of Luise Rainer. Melodramatic, full of presence, she seems always on the verge of breaking down into some farcical display of ham acting, but never quite does so. It's not a realistic performance by any stretch, but it is beautiful in its theatricality.Ziegfeld's influence would live on in musical cinema for many years after his death. The Great Ziegfeld was just the first in a series of pictures tipping their hat to the producer. Meanwhile, many of the stars made famous by Ziegfeld – Billie Burke, Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, Ray Bolger – were finding fruitful careers on the silver screen. It was, after all, the way of the future. You see, it wasn't just the depression that finished Ziegfeld. Even if he had lived, cinema would have provided him with too much competition to continue with his follies, especially with the advent of sound. But this is beside the point. If The Great Ziegfeld shows anything, it is that the spirit of showmanship that he championed could live on, if not in one medium then in another.",13,13,False

Well, for starters, it's based on a true story, and about as loosely as a certain recipient of 11 Oscars I'll be covering in 1997, centering on a famous music professor's life and death by the name of Florenz Ziegfeld (played by William Powell). And by loosely, I mean completely disregarding historical events up until the end in exchange for lavish musical numbers. The plot is simply that he wants to glorify women with music. How does he do that? With the Ziegfeld Follies, and who knows how many glamorized musical numbers. That's it.This is where I take issue with the film; the idea sounds good on paper, but it attempts, and attempts pretty badly, on getting our attention with nothing but splash. There's no depth in any of the performances, we have no reason to care for Ziegfeld hence why the film fails automatically as a character study, nothing about the film is accurate with real events outside of the Stock Market Crash, and it tries to hold our attention for 3 hours. 3 HOURS! Just let that sink in, because all this film offers you is glamor and music (which, to be fair, starts off good, but grows stale over time and quickly runs my patience thin) with nothing else backing it up.There is a reason why it is regarded as one of the worst Best Picture winners of all time, and also a good reason why Musicals became less and less popular with the Academy over the succeeding years (well, this and the next one); it doesn't give us much other than how tedious the thing is to sit through. I would easily give this film a 3 out of 10. Not as bad as Cavalcade, but I'd definitely skip this one.",5,12,True
tt0027698,"""I'm the funniest kind of a fellow. I love ALL the girls.""",7.0,"MGM's epic biopic of theatrical producer Florenz Ziegfeld, starring William Powell in the title role. As with most Hollywood biopics, liberties are taken with the facts. Since this was made in the Golden Age of Hollywood, the intention is to portray Mr. Ziegfeld in the best possible light. If it were made today, the opposite would be true and all his faults would be emphasized (probably to the point of slander). I'll leave it to you to decide which is the better approach. Anyway, the movie covers Ziegfeld's rise as a Barnum-esque showman to becoming one of Broadway's most successful producers with his Ziegfeld Follies show. Along the way he attracts many women and marries two of them (Luise Rainer, Myrna Loy).It's a spectacle made in the grand Old Hollywood fashion, heavy on melodrama and lavish musical numbers. Powell is fine in the lead. I have no idea how closely he ""gets"" Ziegfeld here, as he seems very much like William Powell's usual screen persona to me. He would reprise his role as Ziegfeld a decade later in 1946's Ziegfeld Follies (also from MGM). Luise Rainer is terrific in her Oscar-winning role as Ziegfeld's first wife, Anna. Myrna Loy is a little miscast as Billie Burke but it's hard to argue against any opportunity to see Powell and Loy on screen together. The rest of the cast includes solid supporting players Frank Morgan, Virginia Bruce, Ray Bolger, Reginald Owen, and Nat Pendleton. A. A. Trimble does a spot-on impersonation of Will Rogers.It is a bit overlong. The first half could have done with some trimming. Still, a fine cast keeps things interesting and those musical numbers are dynamite. Dennis Morgan's ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"" number is one of the highlights. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards with three wins, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Rainer. Its award wins are the subject of debate for some today, who argue it is one of the least-deserving Best Picture winners. That's kind of laughable when you think about it, as the Best Picture Oscar rarely goes to the most deserving film. That was true then and is even more true today, in my opinion. It's definitely something you'll want to try out if you are a fan of classic Hollywood and all its glitz and glamour. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",10,10,False
tt0027698,MGM Lifts Its Weight in Oscar Voting,5.0,"First impressions find William Powell (as Florenz ""Ziggy"" Ziegfeld Jr.) acting a little inebriated and a somewhat uncertain about his characterization; his ""My Man Godfrey"" (also 1936) performance is superior. Early on, co-star Frank Morgan (as Jack Billings) and Mr. Powell are reciting lines in the dark. They are more comfortable as the hours pass. The second half-hour introduces French-accented showgirl Luise Rainer (as Anna Held), who won an ""Academy Award"" as ""Best Actress"" for her supporting role... Ms. Rainer occasionally adds some spark to the story, but her award for giving the best female performance of the year 1936 is arguable to the extreme. After an hour, dancer Ray Bolger takes the spotlight. Then, just before the intermission, watch for the extravagant ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"" production number; this is the film's highlight. After the hour and a half point, find Mr. Bolger's dance solo. Just around the two-hour mark, Fanny Brice appears, to sing a partial ""My Man"". Myrna Loy (as Billie Burke) finally arrives, also. Rainer's tearful telephone scene follows. MGM corralled their then majority vote at ""Oscar"" time.***** The Great Ziegfeld (3/22/36) Robert Z.

tt0027698,The Man's Contribution To The American Musical Theater Is Legendary,9.0,"Until Gone With The Wind, The Great Ziegfeld was MGM's biggest production and it seems fitting that such a large scale musical was put together to tell the life of its title character. It's a very sanitized version of Florenz Ziegfeld's life. One has to remember however that his widow, Billie Burke, was very much alive and active in Hollywood and controlling the rights to his name good or bad.In William Powell an actor charming enough was certainly found for the lead. Ziegfeld had to be that, how else could he have gotten so many beautiful to star in his shows and into the sack. His was the original casting couch of Broadway, imitated on a grand scale in Hollywood.Yet the man's contribution to the American musical theater is legendary. Others like Earl Carroll, George White, the brothers Shubert, all tried to imitate his Ziegfeld Follies, none really quite captured the touch. Though there are a diminishing group of people who have seen the stars he created, the names of Bert Williams, Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, W.C. Fields, and Fanny Brice are still known to us all. In Fanny we get the genuine article in this film and fans of Barbra Streisand can judge for themselves how effective Barbra's portrayal of Fanny Brice was in Funny Girl and Funny Lady.One star who is missing is Marilyn Miller. Sad to say she was to die the year that The Great Ziegfeld came out. Her life is somewhat suggested by the part that Virginia Bruce had. She also had a very sanitized film about her life in Look for the Silver Lining.Though you wouldn't know it as the script was oh so careful, Florenz Ziegfeld and Anna Held were not legally married. Luise Rainer got her first Academy Award for playing Anna Held. That telephone scene is a classic, still studied by players for those who have to do a long soliloquy. Note how she uses the phone receiver as a prop.Myrna Loy had a most difficult part in playing Billie Burke and it was something not to be envied as Billie was a notable character actress even before she was Glinda the Good Witch. I'm not quite sure she captured Burke, yet I doubt Billie was that silly in real life.Besides Luise Rainer's Oscar, The Great Ziegfeld won Oscars for Dance Direction when there were enough musicals being made to warrant such a category and it was The Best Picture of 1936. That A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody number was as good as anything Busby Berkeley was doing over at Warner Brothers.And that number gives you some idea of the scope and glamor of the Ziegfeld Follies. Ziggy would have approved.",7,9,False

Apparently, the road to get there must be appealing or interesting for us, the viewer.Well, at times it is, at times it's not. The movie definately suffers from it's length, which isn't used to tie up all the ends. Let's take the girl named Mary Lou for instance. At first, we meet her when she's a child. Then she comes back in her early twenties. We expect something is happening between her and 'Flo', but there isn't and she leaves the stage (if you will) as soon as she got there. What was happening there?It all looks great (check out the stairs-scene approaching the interlude) but that's not enough to claim classic status I'm afraid.5/10.",4,9,False
tt0027698,Wears out its welcome but the standard for lavish musicals.,7.0,"At over 3 hours long this film is just too much of a good thing. It's not even so much scenes have to be cut out as existing scenes need to be cut down. A good example of this is the joke about Held wanting to get away from Ziegfeld only to change her mind at the last second is repeated one too many times. Likewise, the musical numbers are splendid but shallow in light of having no real thematic or narrative content. The film is a light musical comedy but 3 hours of it is just too much. It's like too much sweets.The narrative could have been deeper and darker if the film was willing to explore Ziegfeld's flaws more. But without this backbone the material is fun but hackneyed and lacking enough dramatic weight. Yet Powell is charming,Morgan is hysterical and Rainer is delightful. Enough so that even after the film has been too long you are still mostly having fun. The bloat needed to be cut or the film needed to be deeper.Nonetheless, much of this film-the musical numbers now-is still absolutely glorious, memorizing and enchanting.""A Pretty Girl is like a Melody"" might be the most daring musical number ever out to screen.

Mike Stone and Michael Douglas as the younger partner Inspector Steve Keller, the 70's, R&B-style theme music by Patrick Williams and the cool, pre-MTV opening credits.What really made this show better than most is the fact that Quinn Martin did spend the extra money and filmed the show entirely in San Francisco. In the 70s, most prime time TV shows were filmed in Los Angeles. I believe Hawaii Five-O was one of only a few prime-time dramas from the early 70s that was filmed on location.When Douglas left the series and Richard Hatch (from the original Battlestar Galactica, not the Richard Hatch from the first Survivor) replaced him, I quickly lost interest in the show. The chemistry between Malden and Douglas was very important to the show and Hatch had the thankless task of creating a character that in the long run was bland.Despite the show's final season, I'm certain that if I had the TV on and heard the drum beats of The Streets of San Francisco theme, I am very sure that I will probably spend the rest of the hour watching the show.",33,38,False

Recently, I decided to try watching a few of these series and found I really liked many of them still. Sadly, ""The Streets of San Francisco"" wasn't one of them. After watching the first two discs of Season One from Netflix, I found that the writing was a serious problem. Too many plot holes and way too many weird plot elements made this show hard to stick with for long. For instance? In the pilot, the killer turns out to be an old-time actor who dresses like Anton LaVey and has built a dungeon where he can torment his victims!! In the second episode, you have a Jack the Ripper-like guy hacking up prostitutes! In the next episode, you have a crazed kidnapper and ultra-violent guy talked out of crime after conversing with the Detective! In the one after that, a guy who recreates women to look like a woman he murdered--so he can then murder them!! All of these crimes are insanely bizarre--too bizarre to be believed.

tt0068135,Republic Pictures Home Video Releases,,"Republic Pictures' five released VHS videos which represent eight different episodes are, I hope, the first of a complete series release. In recent years, ""Streets"" has been relegated to the pre-dawn graveyard of Indie and cable television stations, edited down to allow for more ghastly, no-budget local ads (trade schools, lawyers, and the like). Nowadays, low self-esteem broadcasters plaster their logos and moving promo messages along the bottom of the as if the program is an interruption of their commercials. So, what a treat to see these classic episodes without all of these distractions. Although popular enough to run for five seasons, it never received the credit it deserved -- none of the hype of a ""Charlie's Angels,"" for example. It's too bad that Michael Douglas didn't stick with the show. His performances in ""Streets"" and ""The China Syndrome"" are among his best. I'm crossing my fingers that he'll consider returning to a follow-up ""Streets"" later in his career, taking the senior detective's role that Malden held in the original.;""Streets"" always had tight scripts, good plotting, and interesting characters -- even if they pandered to stereotypes a little. Way ahead of its time, gay themes are treated with surprising tact and good taste. In the episode ""Harem,"" guest star Rick Nelson plays a gay pimp for female prostitutes (a novel idea in and of itself). The word ""gay"" is never used, but Steve (Douglas) simply tells Mike (Malden) that, ""he's not exactly what you'd call a ladies man.""The two-hour special ""Thrill Killers,"" is perhaps the most interesting release. Patty Duke Astin plays a not-too-thinly disguised Patty Hearst (a headline story at that time) who takes a whole jury hostage and begins killing them one by one. It's a relief not to have to wait a week to see part two. The least interesting of these releases is ""Dead Air,"" starring Larry Hagman as a radio talk show host (reminiscent of Bill Balance's Feminine Forum, an innovative show at the time). The studio scenes are completely unrealistic and the killer can be guessed before the end of Act 1. Unfortunately, none of these eight releases includes an episode from ""Streets"" most famous director, Richard Donner (""The Omen"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" series.) Maybe they'll release some of his episodes on DVD with a director's commentary?

It seems with these criminals the risk they take is more important than the profit they make. Yet they make that profit, or at least try to, they run their risks and they get caught by the ""villainous"" cops who are only there to get their heads, or at least their mugs, on their walls over their fireplaces, if they have a fireplace, because what's more these cops are poor and badly paid. Why on earth do they track boys and girls who make more money in one month than they do in a couple of decades? Because these cops are perverts and that is obvious from the very start. You have to be a pervert to arrest a criminal and find pleasure, pride and even fame in doing that. But these cops are bringing to the profession another dimension, a human and even humane dimension. They are moved into action by the suffering of the people, by the social dimension of their cases, by the emotional and even sentimental sides of their situations. There is always a lot of love lost somewhere that is found again, or a lot of love that could have been lost and is retained. There is also a lesson about Pearl Harbor and about all kinds of jingoism or sectarianism or segregation or racism, or whatever that makes life and humanity dirty looking and mean sounding. Those two cops seem to be trying to create harmony, to be scoring some music and tuning all the voices of the big social choir to the one single pitch that could please human ears and from time to time divine ears, but not too much nor too many. The 50 odd minute episodes are not too long but are short enough to be packed and dense and that is an advantage, a good asset. The structure in four acts and one epilog is also rather nice though of course the format is becoming a limitation little by little. Some more complex cases cannot be solved in four little acts and one short epilog and fifty minutes is rather short on TV. But that was the format on TV in these late 60s and early 70s when color TV became popular. My first color TV in 1969 with Bonanza, Mission Impossible, Love American Style and so many other programs. That sure was another time and television was not an isolating tool yet but rather a machine around which people gathered and enjoyed some time together every night. A tremendous leap forward toward a culture for all and a social reflection for everybody and with everybody. So these programs had to be popular and police drama had to be close to people, close with a city like San Francisco that has always had a reputation to be friendly and easy going, with simple people who are severely hurt and maimed by crime and with some other people who suffer tremendously because of the consequences of the actions of criminals. That reveals though another type of courage, the courage to suffer in order to bring about justice and simple people who are the victims of such crimes are often willing to help justice rather than to get a vengeance. And Bonanza was the same and Mission Impossible was the same and Clint Eastwood and his spaghetti westerns were the same. It is not so much the cops themselves that bring peace to the community but the victims of crime that do and when one becomes a stray cat of justice and wants to be a vigilante or a pistolero or a gunslinger, then the whole universe reacts and brings that lost sheep back into the corral. OK Corral of course and more than Dead or Alive we want the criminals alive for the court and the judge and the jury. This series is still quite viewable and decent, and even emotional and at times slightly poignant.

The first of the Warner Bros ""biopics"", it can boast of a great performance by Paul Muni, with none of the mannerisms that became a trade mark in the last and sorry years of his career. It was an example of the ""good citizenship"" that Warner Broa boasted of: a highly educational film that at the same time was very entertaining. The screen play was masterful and won the Oscar it the deserved. Authors Sheridan Gibney and Pierre Collings were able to dramatize scientific struggles and investigations. This was also the beginning of the most fruitful period in William Dieterle's career, an from that moment on he shared with Michael Curtiz the top assignments at Warner. It is now known that The Story of Louis Pasteur was made with a very low budget. You don't notice it. It is a wonderful show, as was the following year ""The Life of Emile Zola"" and, with some reservations, ""Juarez"" in 1939.

tt0028313,Wisdom And Perseverance,9.0,"1936 was the career turning point year for Paul Muni. It was the year that he got the first of three biographical films at Warner Brothers that would forever give him his place in cinema history. The Story of Louis Pasteur (1827-1895) was also the film that got Muni his Academy Award for Best Actor that year.It's hard to imagine the world of science and medicine without the contributions of Pasteur. He was a chemist and as such his scientific experiments when they encroached on the medical field was greeted with suspicion and hostility. His chief critic Dr. Charbonnet played by Fritz Lieber nearly sank Pasteur's work with a bold move that I cannot tell about, but will make you gasp when you see it on screen.Josephine Hutchinson is Muni's ever faithful wife Marie and she does well by what is really a rather colorless part. It was the same for Muni in his biographical picture the following year of Emile Zola where Gloria Holden also had a part that called for little, but to look faithful. There is a nice subplot involving Donald Woods as an early convert to Pasteur's way of thinking wooing and winning daughter Anita Louise.The film goes through Pasteur's main achievements of sterilization during medical procedures and cures for anthrax and hydrophobia. The story and screenplay which also won Oscars for 1936 is simple and straightforward enough for any lay person to follow.There are several good performances of men of science who opposed and/or supported Pasteur's work, in some cases opposed then supported. Porter Hall, Akim Tamiroff, and Halliwell Hobbes who has a small part as Joseph Lister, the English scientist.Pasteur fought hard for his ideas against the medical and scientific establishment of his day and lived long enough to receive due acclaim from his nation of France and the world.

He seemed to always play intense roles.The story is very frustrating, however, as we watch ""Pasteur"" become the target of an ignorant medical profession at the time, constantly trying to discredit the famous man's work. We know, of course, through history that he was right so to listen to his naysayers go on and on and on is frustrating.

tt0028313,More fiction than fact,3.0,"Apparently none of the previous reviewers,most of whom praise the film for its accuracy, have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur.The most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.Back in the 1930's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light.While far from an admirable character-he was an inept politician and a self-appointed ""military genius"" who allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war,he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here. He had an intelligent interest in science,and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring.Far from exiling Pasteur, he was his PATRON,building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research.While the lab was under construction, Pasteur became gravely ill.A bureaucrat, deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead, ordered work halted on his own authority.When the emperor heard about this, his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck-passing, and work promptly resumed.The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab.The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur's projects,and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperor's favorites.Pasteur's main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything, and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience.Pasteur, a very modest man, was always protesting this, but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him,and Pasteur despite his misgivings, always came through.They always had a close and friendly relationship,and after the Emperor was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him,grateful to the end of his life.The part about his daughter having the baby, and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor, never happened.The part about the anthrax and rabies, for which he was famous, is generally correct, but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false.He was famous and respected at the time this happened.This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint,but very distorted as biography.",15,19,True

I was really shocked at how well Muni was here because I was a little skeptical going in.

Paul Muni gives an impressive, Oscar-winning performance as Louis Pasteur, so fiercely dedicated to his findings and the results they receive, he drives himself to a partial stroke.

Robinson) is Warner Brother's answer to this MGM film and BOTH are well worth seeing and are about equally entertaining.Paul Muni plays Pasteur, though much of his earlier career is left out of the film. Instead of his many advances and breakthroughs, the film focuses on three--his sterilization crusade, his inoculation for Anthrax and his cure for Rabies. This is probably not a bad idea, since the film never would have fit into the a standard length otherwise.I also assume that some of the characters in the film were fictitious, as I tried doing an internet search on Dr. Charbonnet as well as read up on Pasteur and could not verify some of the film's details--this isn't at all unusual for a bio-pic from the 1930s plus none of this fundamentally changed the overall facts.The film is well-written, compelling and makes science kind of cool.

Strangely, there is nothing about pasteurization, although with a great scientist who was responsible for so many innovations, you can't show everything. And certainly the rabies and anthrax stories are more dramatic.Some of the film, I believe, is fictionalized - his nemesis, Dr. Charbonnet, was probably created to represent some of the criticism Pasteur faced in his lifetime. The love affair between his assistant, Dr. Martel (Donald Woods) and Pasteur's daughter Annette doesn't seem to be true either.

tt0028313,A story well worth telling,8.0,"Louis Pasteur was an important and pioneering figure in his field and ever, and his discoveries were revolutionary. He also had a very interesting life well worth telling, and one that lends itself well to film. Even though a film would not be able to cover everything about his life, it was an eventful personal life and he revolutionised so much. It would fare even better as a mini-series.'The Story of Louis Pasteur' was one of the first biopics that came to be (and also the first of those from Warner Brothers), and it is one of the better early ones. Although not quite one of my favourite biographical films of all time, 'The Story of Louis Pasteur' is a fine example of how to do it right. Meaning that of course there would be fictional elements, and it is these elements that ring the least true here, but the subject, their personal life and what made them so important are treated with respect and not rose-tinted, distorted or falsified. Pasteur is still a very interesting man and we do see what made him a pioneering and revolutionary figure. 'The Story of Louis Pasteur' is at its weakest in the romantic element of the story, which didn't engage as much as the rest of the film and didn't fit as well either.Also the performances of Anita Louise and Donald Woods who struck me as a little colourless. Wouldn't have said no to 'The Story of Louis Pasteur' being longer, it did feel too brief and one does wish that there was even more to the story than was told. However, the story is thoroughly compelling and while not everything is there it does focus on what were particularly revolutionary and in a way that engages a lot and are very intriguing, found myself learning a fair bit. Found myself relating to Pasteur with his struggles against adversity and his eventual overcoming, having been there myself.One does not notice that 'The Story of Louis Pasteur' is low budget, it is lovingly photographed and handsomely designed. The script is literate without being worthy and very thought-provoking with a surprising amount of complexity and respect for the subject and the ability to entertain and educate. The direction keeps the film moving along briskly with few dull spots. The film is particularly worth seeing for the terrific and deservedly Oscar-winning performance of Paul Muni.

Not just because of the quality of film elements, but also because of a maturity in scripts. In a sense, I always compare films in this general period to ""Gone With The Wind"". And compared to GWTW and several other films of 1939, this film -- made only 3 years earlier -- seems old-fashioned. That is not to say that it is not a good film. It is excellent. It's one of several great bio-pics of that era, and one that earned its star (Paul Muni) an Oscar; the screenplay also won an Oscar. Both well deserved.I'm sure that there will be those who will point out inaccuracies in the film...liberties that the screenwriters took to make it a good story. But, the gist of the story is accurate and makes the key point -- how daring such early scientists were, basically starting with nothing but an idea, pursing it, and developing great discoveries. It is rather inspirational.The cast here is superb. As I mentioned, Paul Muni received the Best Actor Oscar, and it was only right that he did. A number of the supporting actors did a terrific job as well: Josephine Hutchinson -- a much underrated actress as Marie Pasteur. Donald Woods as an associate doctor. Halliwell Hobbes as Dr. Lister.

tt0028313,The story of a legendary chemist!,8.0,"It was the latter half of the 19th century. The year was 1860, ten years before the French Third Republic came into being. Medical Science hadn't made the kind of advancements that it saw later, and disease and death were in abundance. It was a well-known fact that thirty percent of women died in childbirth due to Puerperal fever, better known as childbed fever, accounting for about twenty thousand annual deaths in the city alone! Yet there was a grave ignorance of monumental proportions, even as one man, a chemist dared to think differently. He urged medical practitioners to boil their instruments; or in modern parlance, 'sterilize' them, before using on patients in addition to thoroughly washing their hands with a disinfectant before working on patients. He firmly believed that more than half the deaths were caused due to lack of hygiene and the transmission of 'germs' from objects such as the doctor's instruments! Not surprisingly, the man was laughed at, and written off to be a charlatan, a quack! After all, what would a chemist know, that the doctors couldn't see! But the man had seen it all. He had first discovered what causes wine to go sour. His relentless experimentation in his laboratory had helped him discover that microorganisms were the major cause of disease (while the doctors still firmly believed that these organisms were a result of disease rather than the cause!).The man was Louis Pasteur. And the technique he gave to the world was pasteurization! William Dieterle's 1936 biographical film ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"", at its modest 85 minutes length, is a tad short to even qualify for a proper biographical film. It begins on a rather startling note with the scene of a doctor being shot by a silhouetted gunman. One wonders if they've taken cinematic liberties to such an extent as to make the lead actor Paul Muni feel at home owing to his crime film beginnings! It is later learnt that Pasteur is indirectly responsible for the murder of the doctor, for reasons best left for the viewer to find out! It's a rather silly beginning, one the film could've easily done without. ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" does take a few minutes to attain a grip on its narrative which eventually does make for very engaging drama.It is astonishing how a simple film revolving around a man and his microscope has been made into something so riveting, that you can't take your eyes off, once it picks up steam. The primary focus is on Pasteur's taxing attempts to prove to the then Emperor Napolean III, his findings about the microscopic creatures and their connection to disease, and later, post the advent of the Third republic, his diligent attempts at developing the first successful vaccines for deadly diseases like Anthrax and Rabies. Of course, there is resistance to his claims and discoveries, more specifically from Pasteur's most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet (Fritz Leiber). As the audience, our hearts go all out to Pasteur and we find ourselves rooting for the industrious scientist. We watch with bated breath and find ourselves praying for him to succeed in his experiments, even when we are well aware of the eventual outcome. We feel the triumph felt by Pasteur when he weeps tears of joy upon tasting victory! But Pasteur didn't succeed instantly. There were numerous failed attempts and broken test tubes and dead ends from whence he found new directions. The entire medical fraternity turned against him but he stood his ground and ended up having the last laugh anyway! But the path to victory wasn't easy for him, and ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" succeeds in conveying to us, this particular facet of Pasteur's dedication to science. It is heartening to watch Pasteur and his loyal team of scientists toil away in the laboratory attached to his house, as his devoted wife Marie (Josephine Hutchinson) cooks supper for the entire team and also stands by her husband through thick and thin. It is awe-inspiring to see him stumble upon clues almost by accident that lead him to make some of the most startling discoveries known to mankind now. It is also slightly scary to see him succumb to a suggestion of using an untested vaccine on a little boy who is supposedly at death's door anyway! The film may appear somewhat dated with regard to the set design and slightly poor production values. But that is hardly a hindrance, thanks to the gripping script and taut editing. There are some subplots in the film, that weren't entirely necessary, though; that of a romance between Pasteur's daughter Annette (Anita Louise) and the young Dr. Martel (Donald Woods) who wins Pasteur's favor earlier in the film. It seems to be there merely to dramatize the proceedings. Ditto for the climactic twist of fate in the final few minutes when Annette is on the brink of delivering a baby. The events in those last few minutes seem contrived to the extent of being melodramatic, although, by then you are so in love with the protagonist that you don't care for the minor hiccups. Because mostly, apart from the solid performance of Fritz Leiber, it is the magnificent Paul Muni that holds our attention.The under-appreciated Paul Muni, in his Oscar winning performance of the steadfast scientist, manages to render this film much more watchable than it actually is. It is his earnest act that ultimately salvages even the weakest scene. His final speech, just minutes before ""The End"" flashes on the screen, as he struggles with a walking stick, thanks to being in a recovery phase from a paralytic stroke, is nothing short of inspiring!

Unfortunately, a contest to see how many sheep will die from anthrax is a bit melodramatic. The scientist, even in that century, would have to put considerable controls on his experiments. In this we have the most simplistic Hollywood view of a great man. Granted it was good that sometimes they chose their subjects from the scientific community (Bell and Edison for two), but they didn't try very hard to bring them to life by putting the forces of the time to bear. There is also the sappy family life thing going on which is a bit of a distraction, and the romantic story is really mindless. Still, watching Paul Muni shows what fine actors were around.",5,8,False

Since it did win Oscars-screenplay and Paul Muni's only Best Actor award-I expected it to be good. I think Paul Muni's a wonderful actor, but he didn't deserve even a nomination for this movie.The story is compelling to modern audiences, and since Paul's hair and makeup was created to look very much like Louis Pasteur, people were swept away. I think it was a case of ""Daniel Day-Lewis-itis"" and Paul was given an Oscar because of his beard. The film chronicles Pasteur's push for proving that germs exist and cause disease and infection. The opening of the film shows a doctor dropping his instruments on the ground, picking them up and putting them back in his bag, with the implication that he'll be using them without sterilization. Before Pasteur, doctors didn't wash their hands or their instruments, and they didn't believe in germs. It's a great beginning, effectively drawing the audience in, but the rest of the film doesn't live up to the hype.If you're passionate about the subject, you'll probably like this movie. I just thought it was going to a masterpiece, so I was disappointed. I'm passionate about Paul Muni, so I'll stick with I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, which he should have won his Oscar for.",3,7,False
tt0028313,The French Scientist,9.0,"THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR (Warner Brothers, 1936), directed by William Dieterle, starring Paul Muni, might have become a box-office failure considering its then theatrical popularity being swashbucklers, screwball comedies, love stories, screen adaptations to literary classics or the musicals. As much as a life story about a 19th century French scientist would only have limited appeal, being more of a history lesson retold on screen rather than history lesson taught in the classroom, the movie itself went into production anyway. Having little or no expectation except for Paul Muni, the sort of actor willing to assume the gamble to a point of not even caring if the movie proved popular or not, THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR not only became an unexpected success, paving the way for other biographical stories to follow, but won Paul Muni the Academy Award as Best Actor for his memorable performance. Rather than starting the story of Louis Pasteur as a child, leading to his scientific profession and courtship with his future wife, the original story and screenplay by Sheridan Gibney and Pierre Collins gets down to basics starting in 1860 with the shooting of Doctor Francois (William Burress) by an irate husband (William B. Davidson) whose wife died under his carelessness by using dirty instruments for treatment. After the husband presents the reasons for his actions to the police with a newspaper clipping by Louis Pasteur stating how microbes cause diseases and death, the scientists of the French Academy label Pasteur as a ""menace to science."" Louis Pasteur (Paul Muni) is then introduced as a chemist with a young wife, Marie (Josephine Hutchinson), and father to three children, the eldest being a daughter named Annette (Anita Louise). Pasteur expresses his reasoning and anger through the ignorance of doctors who fail to boil their instruments and wash their hands to kill germs before attending to their patients. Disbelieved or ridiculed by the doctors, Pasteur's theories are believed by few, including Doctor Jean Martel (Donald Woods), a young physical and surgeon working under Doctor Charbonnet (Fritz Lieber). Martel leaves Charbonnet's employ to work under Pasteur and Doctor Emile Roux (Henry O'Neill), dedicating themselves pursuing the deadly microbes that cause antrax and hydrophobia and cures, followed by Pasteur's painstaking attempt to find the cure for rabies as found on Philip Meister (Dickie Moore), a little boy left under his care, and testings on the child that could lead to Pasteur's imprisonment if he should fail.The supporting cast also includes: Porter Hall (Doctor Rosignol); Raymond Brown (Doctor Aradisse); Akim Tamiroff (Doctor Zaranoff); Iphigenie Castiglioni (Empress Eugenie); and Halliwell Hobbes (Doctor Lister from England), among others. The romantic interest between Donald Woods and Anita Louise is limited, while Josephine Hutchinson enacts her character typical fashion of the devoted and caring wife believing in her husband's scientific research. (Whatever became of the two younger Pasteur children seen early in the story before disappearing from view with no explanation?) The plot, in general, offers enough material to provide the story of Louis Pasteur, with extended scenes of investigation of the anthrax disease at the Pouilly Le Fort, dividing 24 vaccinated sheep with 24 non-vaccinated ones to see which ones survive; Pasteur's desperation in having Doctor Charbonnet follow his method of delivering his daughter's baby; but eliminates the use and term of ""pasteurization"" of milk for which he is most famous.While there have been earlier biographical stories, many of them being more fiction than fact, THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR is no different, offering its blend of both, which really doesn't hurt the concept of the story by any means. At 85 minutes rather than an overblown two hour plus spectacle, Paul Muni, with glasses, beard but minus French accent, is the whole show here. He alone makes it worth viewing. His success would follow with other biographical successes and heavy makeup for THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA (1937) and JUAREZ (1939), but it's Muni's Pasteur that's most remembered while Muni, the Actor himself, is virtually forgotten today. Distributed on video cassette in the 1990s, and later DVD, THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR can be seen and historically studied for examination term paper in science class on Turner Classic Movies.

However, in the 1930s he was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, and for good reason: he was one of its greatest and most talented actors, and proved in this movie, a bio-pic about a scientist who fought against institutional ignorance to save lives. The story is straight forward: women are dying from infection during child birth and the medical establishment refuses to believe that the infections are caused by ""microbes."" Louis Pasteur, who is not even a medical doctor, insists that microbes DO cause the infections and that the medical doctors are at fault for not disinfecting their hands and equipment before treating the women. The story then comes down to Pasteur trying to prove that he is right and the medical establishment wrong.

The humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old Deanna, a little beauty with a gorgeous voice, as the ""Miss Fixit"" in a family split by divorce. For plot summary, see other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. With an excellent supporting cast especially Barbara Read and Nan Grey as the sisters, good direction and editing, the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings. Of Deanna's three songs, only ""Il Bacio"" is from the classical repertoire, but when she sings it in that police station scene, the film's place in history is assured. At least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many nice touches that occur throughout THREE SMART GIRLS is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck for a final glimpse of Deanna as the cops hustle him by! One unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for Durbin vehicles became locked into the ""Miss Fixit"" theme, which quickly became stale. Deanna herself never did. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had.

The combination works well, and is not as easy as it looks, as is so often demonstrated by the numerous gauche, hammy ""family comedies"" of more recent years.Although she was quite young at the time, Durbin already had quite a singing voice, and she also had the kind of stage presence that allows her young character to take command of a scene in ways that would otherwise seem forced.  She and the other two of the ""Three Smart Girls"" make a winning and energetic set of heroines.  The rest of the cast members do well, too, and several of them have some very good moments.  Charles Winninger makes the indecisive father very believable, Ray Milland's smooth, slightly exaggerated performance fits in nicely, Mischa Auer steals a number of scenes, and Binnie Barnes keeps her ""other woman"" character from being a stereotype.Despite having a short career, Deanna Durbin left behind several very pleasant, enjoyable pictures that are worth the trouble to find for fans of classic cinema.

This 1937 was her first major film, and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered Universal Studios.THREE SMART GIRLS concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother. Although the story is slight, the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch. Durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality, and such enjoyable character actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson, and Mischa Auer round out the cast.

Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, Durbin looks much older, as in adult. And so do all of her so-called siblings. And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. So you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start ""hitting on"" them you get the feeling as if they're pedophiles, and you might be one, too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out. Teens or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as.The parents, too, seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.It is a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.",4,16,True

Dad hasn't seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) don't seem to mind and think he's wonderful, and meanwhile Precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters get the idea of pushing Precious into the path of a drunken Hungarian count, tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking Ray Milland, who goes along with the scheme 'cause he has a crush on sister Kay.This film is enjoyable, light fare. Barbara Read as Kay comes across as sweet and pretty, Ray Milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, is given little to do), Alice Brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is Deanna Durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the film, though I actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. The plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found the film to be entertaining and fun.",11,13,False
tt0028373,Deanna's feature film debut shows she had an amazing voice...,6.0,"MGM dropped Deanna Durbin after one short subject she made in '36 called ""Everybody Sings"" with Judy Garland. They kept Garland and dropped Durbin, whereby Universal took a chance on Deanna--who turned out to save the studio from bankruptcy with a string of successful, but formula Durbin films. She would go on playing Little Miss Fix-It in a number of vehicles written for the express purpose of exploiting Durbin's wonderful soprano voice.THREE SMART GIRLS, when seen today, is a charming but very dated tale about three teen-age sisters scheming to reunite their parents. It was the sort of thing MGM would later do with JANE POWELL who, like Durbin, had a pleasing soprano voice and was routinely given the same Miss Fix-It roles, usually in an attempt to reunite her parents too.CHARLES WINNINGER is the father who hasn't seen his daughters in ten years. Daughters DEANNA DURBIN, NAN GREY and BARBARA READ are intent on breaking up their father's romance with ""the other woman"" BINNIE BARNES. A very youthful RAY MILLAND (looking like a matinée idol), provides the romantic interest for one of the girls.It's all played in very broad style, particularly by ALICE BRADY as Barnes' society mother, filmed in ritzy surroundings that must have seemed terribly unreal to Depression-era audiences and Durbin and the girls are a little too self-confident and condescending in their attitudes to be the likable girls they're supposed to be. But none of it bears much resemblance to reality--a fault of many a classic '30s comedy.The material isn't sufficiently bright enough to keep you from wondering when Deanna will sing again--and it's surprising to learn that this was nominated for Best Picture in 1936.Summing up: Definitely not one of my favorite Durbin films even though she shows her perky personality...nor am I fond of the ""Penny"" character that she plays here...but when she sings, all is forgiven.",4,13,False
tt0028373,And introducing Universal's new discovery,7.0,"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.",12,12,False

tt0028373,Spoiler!!! Focuses on classical Hollywood style.,,"Henry Koster's film is a seamless classical hollywood goal-driven narrative with elements of a musical, romantic comedy and layers of mistaken identity, all accelerated to a final climax and resolution by the interjection of a temporal goal deadline within the film.  Deanna Durbin serves as the focal character of the three sisters, all working together to attain one common goal  to break up their estranged father's engagement and to reunite him with their mother.  While the sisters work as a united front to achieve their goal, each is developed, in part, using the playful bicker that invariably accompanies the sisters' interactions.This film is also a romantic comedy filmed in the `sophisticated world of the social aristocracy'(1). True to the roots of the big studio Romantic comedies of the 1930's and 40's, this film features lavish settings of wealth and prestige providing an escape, however brief, for movie goers from the depression.  The film opens with a display of wealth by depicting the comfortable lifestyle that the girls enjoy with their mother in Europe. During this opening scene in which the sisters are outside on their sailboa t with Durbin singing, merrily sailing down a stream near their home.  The narrative goal is set soon after this opening sequence when the sisters are called in for lunch by a housekeeper.  Once inside,  they discover that their father is to marry a famous glamor girl in the US.  Fueled by the desire to quell their mother's sorrow, the girls set off to America to win over their father by turning him away from his pending marriage and stealthily persuading him to return to their mother.  Upon their arrival the sisters discover the difficulty of their goal; the fiancee and her mother are aware of the girl's meddling ways and are determined to frustrate the girls attempts at intervention.The bulk of the film is filled with trials and tribulations that both frustrate the girl's goals as well as push them closer to completing their objectives in unplanned ways.  The dichotomy of wealth and worth is represented in many ways in this film.  Class, social status and money play a pivotal role in the nuances of the plot as the sisters try to get the fiancee to `latch on' to another man who has a title and more wealth.  The gold digging nature of the fiancee is pivotal in the many efforts used by the sisters to break the engagement.  It is obvious that the engagement is not based on love, which further leads the viewer to root for the girls successful intervention.  The fiancee's determination to marry into wealth eventually serves as the key to the girl's success, however unexpectedly, and simultaneously thwarts her own opportunities at such a marriage.The sisters form a powerful team within which each has a very different personality.  Each tactic they employ to break up the engagement begins to be thwarted by the romantic entanglements of the 2 older sisters with two of the men they are using to manipulate the fiancee, effectively twisting the plot in on itself many time during the film and providing ample barbing dialogue between the 2 courting couples.  (Durbin's character is only 14 years old, so the romantic comedy portions of the film take place in the other characters relations with each other.)Throughout the film, Durbin is asserted as the main character through long, close-up voice solos that solidify her role as the central character. These musical interludes serve also as plot devices to win over adoration and support from her listeners within the film (as well as the audience), bringing her closer to her goals.   In a classic use of editing to tell a story, the emotional effect of her voice on other characters is clearly implied using an editing style that switches between an extreme close-up of the singing Durbin and an equally extreme close-up of the expressions of her captivated listeners(1). These interludes also showcase the sound quality of the film  The lack of background noise and the clarity and range of her singing voice are used to draw out emotion in the viewer as they get to know more intimately this young character they are rooting for so firmly.;The sense of temporal urgency takes hold of the film when the wedding date is suddenly rescheduled for the following day by the sly fiancee and her mother in order to outwit the girls' schemes.  This plot twist serves to shift the narrative from goal based to urgently time focused(1).  The girls are forced to call on all of the contacts they've made (with a big dose of luck) to succeed in the end.  With this shift to a frantic countdown in plot action, the film becomes very compelling, with the outcome uncertain until the very end.  The narrative reaches resolution when, in the final scene, the mother arrives from overseas and is greeted by her triumphant daughters and her ex-husband.  Although the success of this meeting is far from assured, the development of the daughter's characters as intelligent, persuasive, and strong willed almost convinces the audience of a successful reunion.

tt0028373,Durbin and Powell Weren't That Much Alike,8.0,"I'm surprised at the comments from posters stating that Jane Powell made the same type of films Deanna Durbin did. Although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by Joe Pasternak, if this film is any indication, they were almost polar opposites.While, in THREE SMART GIRLS, Durbin plays an impulsive ""Little Miss Fixit,"" who, after some setbacks, manages to reunite her divorced parents, in its' semi-remake, THREE DARING DAUGHTERS, Jane Powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen Mom Jeanette MacDonald and new stepfather Jose Iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him, too. From the Durbin and Powell films I've seen, I'd say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers.As for Durbin's performance in THREE SMART GIRLS, I find it completely winning, and most impressive. Although it's clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for Deanna, watching the self-confident, knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall, and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes, you'd never guess that this was the FIRST film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction. Given that this film, and Durbin herself, were much publicized at the time as ""Universal's last chance,"" the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age, but you'd never know it from the ease and assurance Durbin displays on screen. Although she's clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera (this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like Garland, Rooney, O'Connor and Jane Powell), Durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her, and, even here, in her first film, she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character, and though she's occasionally shrill, she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars, including Jane Powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success.In short, like all great singing stars, Durbin was much more than just a ""beautiful voice."" On the other hand, while Durbin's pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument, the most remarkable thing about it, to me, was the way she is able to project her songs, without the slightest bit of affectation or ""grandnes"" that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like Lily Pons, Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald in films of the periodThe film is also delightful, heavily influenced by screwball comedy, it backs Durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as Charles Winninger, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Milland and Mischa Auer. The story is light and entertaining. True, it's hardly ""realistic,"" but why would anyone expect it to be? If you want :""realistic"" rent THE GRAPES OF WRATH or TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. On the other hand, if you're looking for a genuine, sweet, funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully, charismatic and gifted adolescent ""lead,"" and terrific supporting players, this film won't let you down.",9,9,True

tt0028373,Deanna Durbin in her feature film debut carries the movie with ease; Binnie Barnes hasn't a chance,8.0,"Deanna Durbin, then 14 and just under contract to MGM, made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with Judy Garland, a year younger, in the first film for both of them. Louis B. Mayer then decided he didn't need two competing young singers, placed his bet on Garland and let Durbin go. Universal immediately signed Durbin, rushed her into Three Smart Girls and rewrote the screenplay to pump up her part. She's billed last, but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name. Universal was convinced Durbin would be a smash, and they were right. Three Smart Girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy, and Durbin, 15 when the movie was released, carries it with aplomb. She's Penny Craig, and she and her older sisters, Joan and Kay, are determined to save their father, who had divorced their mother, from the clutches of an elegant gold digger with a fierce mother. They talk their way from Switzerland, where they live, to New York City, where their father lives. They plan not just to break up their father's wedding but to reunite their father with their mother, who after ten years apart still loves the guy. Is there any doubt that Durbin will sing a song or two in her warm, luscious soprano? Nope. Is there any doubt the girls will succeed...with Kay and Joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way? Nope, again. Years later Durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn't keep playing little Miss Fixit forever. She was right, of course, but in Three Smart Girls, her first feature movie, she has little Miss Fixit down pat. Durbin is funny, determined, resourceful, energetic and, of all things, natural. Her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy -- a mix of farce, confusion, good intentions and cheerful avarice -- downright endearing. Durbin carries the movie with ease. It's a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of Binnie Barnes as Donna Lyon, the woman with her hooks in Penny's rich father, played by Charles Winninger, who was no slouch at stealing scenes, either. Alice Brady, who played the dithering matron in My Man Godfrey, plays Donna Lyons' mother, who is even more of a gold digger than her daughter. The last of the accomplished farceurs is Ray Milland as Lord Michael Stuart, who through a contrived and amusing mix-up is mistaken for Mischa Auer. Three Smart Girls holds up well as a light-weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix- ups. So does Deanna Durbin as a brand-new star, who with her huge success saved Universal's bacon.",8,8,False

They learn that their jerk-faced father is remarrying. Apparently, the parents divorced many years earlier and now the daughters want to see if they can break up this marriage and get their parents back together.

Still, the ladies somehow want to bring Daddy back to the bosom of his loving family.So why do I STILL give this movie a 7? Ray Milland.

tt0028373,Craig's Daughters,8.0,"THREE SMART GIRLS (Universal, 1936), directed by Henry Koster, gives indication as a movie set in a classroom revolving around three intellectual students competing in keeping their names on the honor roll or dean's list. Though it does present three school age teenagers as major attractions, it's basically an uplifting story serving as a promotion for three bright stars in the making: Barbara Read, Nan Grey and ""Universal's Newest Discovery,"" Deanna Durbin. Aside from her special billing in the opening credits, Durbin acquires enough attention and close-ups to come as no surprise which one of the ""three smart girls"" is to become an overnight sensation.The story introduces three teenage sisters, Kay (Barbara Read), Joan (Nan Grey) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) living together in the country home in Switzerland with their mother, Dorothy (Nella Walker) and housekeeper, Martha (Lucile Watson). Through a newspaper article, the girls find, to their displeasure, that their New York millionaire banker father, Judson Craig (Charles Winninger), whom their mother divorced ten years ago, intends to marry, Donna Lyons Binnie Barnes), a young socialite he affectionately calls ""Precious."" Donna, along with her mother (Alice Brady), it turns out, are actually fortune hunters after Craig's money. Because this news has hurt their mother, who still loves him, Penny suggests paying Daddy a visit to break up this union. With ""Mummy"" remaining in Switzerland, the girls, accompanied by Martha, take the next boat to New York, after which they surprise both Daddy and his future bride-to-be while dining in an exclusive restaurant. A series of schemes and mishaps follow, including the hiring of Count Arisztid (hilariously played by Mischa Auer), a drunken unemployed Hungarian gigolo, to woo Miss Lyons. Along the way, the elder sisters encounter young men of interest, Bill Evans (John King), who manages Craig's investments; and Lord Michael Stewart(Ray Milland).Reportedly a huge success for Universal, earning an Academy Award nomination as Best Picture of 1936, it shows how important it was for both studio and 14-year-old Deanna Durbin. Being her feature film debut, with only the musical short, ""Every Sunday"" (MGM, 1936) opposite Judy Garland, to her credit, Durbin turned out to be one smart girl for this production. Energetic, vibrant and talented in the singing category, she opens the film singing ""My Heart is Singing"" while rowing the sailboat with her sisters. ""Someone to Care for Me"" (by Gus Kahn, Walter Jurman and Bronislau Kaper) started off earlier with Binnie Barnes attempt to sing while entertaining her guests, in turn serving Durbin to advantage singing it to her father (Winninger). Durbin's final number is the classical piece, ""Il Bacio"" where she sings in a police station for the police chief (John Hamilton).With other capable performers in the cast, Ernest Cossart co-stars as Craig's manservant, Binns; Charles Coleman (Stevens, the butler); Franklin Pangborn (The Jeweler); and Hobart Cavanaugh (Wilbur Lamb, one of Craig's assistants).One of the most revived Durbin films to air on commercial television during the 1960s, THREE SMART GIRLS turned up quite frequently on cable channel American Movie Classics (1993-1996) before shifting over to Turner Classic Movies where it premiered January 14, 2007. Prior to that, THREE SMART GIRLS did get further exposure when distributed to home video in the 1990s. Interestingly, when displayed to DVD a decade later, it became a companion piece with a much latter Durbin musical, SOMETHING IN THE WIND (1947) instead of its sequels, THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP (1939) and HERS TO HOLD (1943). As popular as the original turned out to be, with its blend of music, comedy and sentiment, the sequels were equally successful, though virtually forgotten due to limited television revivals or hard to find VHS copies.THREE SMART GIRLS not only opened a whole new career for Deanna Durbin, but marked the beginning of a whole new cycle of teenage movies later carried on by Judy Garland and others over where Durbin actually got her start, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

tt0028373,Deanna Durbin's Feature Film Debut,6.0,"This movie made 14-year-old Deanna Durbin a big star in 1936 and was such a hit it was one of the ten films nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award that year. It's easy to see why audiences took to Deanna so quickly, she was a beautiful little girl with a stunning voice and she's an appealing young actress even if the script occasionally calls for her to occasionally behave perilously close to a brat or saddles her with predictable ""movie kid"" wisecracks or self-consciously cute bits. The movie itself is actually not one of Deanna's better films although it remains perhaps her most famous. I personally prefer Deanna as an elegant young romantic lead in her twenties in her 1940's films rather than her early films as a chirpy teen sensation.The biggest problem with the movie is the plot and sketchily written characters. Very little of the story rings true. The movie opens with Deanna and her sisters in Switzerland (!!!) where they have lived with their mother for a decade following her divorce from a prominent New York businessman. ""Mummy"" (the girl's saccharine name for her) has been pining away for Daddy darling all the years and now is devastated to learn he is about to remarry. The girls plot to go to New York and stop the impending marriage. Just why they should care is curious - Daddy clearly hasn't given them a thought in ten years and indeed upon their return to the states fails to express any genuine delight at seeing them again and in fact wants them to go back where they came from almost as much as his fiancée Binnie Barnes and her plotting mother Alice Brady does. The girls behave rather horribly for young women supposedly brought up well (although it's played for ""cutes""), screaming and running in restaurants and making nasty cracks about someone they don't know at all. Daddy's complete lack of warmth toward them in the first reels doesn't faze them a bit and they don't even seem to notice it nor is the audience apparently supposed to. Binnie Barnes as the other woman is almost (unintentionally) sympathetic given that old man and his kids.Deanna sings several numbers and dominates the proceedings but the actresses playing her sisters have a good bit of screen time too, both of them having romances with adult men although they are clearly teen-aged (though the movie tells us they are ""grown up""). Neither Nan Grey or Barbara Read however can overcome the script's traps quite as successfully as Deanna but it's possible the director didn't bother much with helping them out of them since the movie is clearly a star vehicle for Miss Durbin. Ray Milland (shortly before reaching stardom) is featured as one of the girl's conquests, a dashing young man who turns out to be even richer than daddy. He is also a decade older than the actress who plays his love interest and it's kind of unseemly watching the 31-year-old Milland wooing Barbara Read (18 and looking younger) although Milland's friendly, likable personality overcomes much of this. Alice Brady is Deanna's main competition as far as being the film's greatest asset, with Brady playing a decidedly more bitchy version of her scatterbrain mother role from so many other films. But is is Deanna's film and she manages perform sincerely in an artificial story and in the last scene is downright true and touching at as she cries to herself for having successfully accomplished her mission.",5,5,True

SYNOPSIS: Three wealthy, spoilt teenage girls decide to wreck the forthcoming marriage of their estranged father (a New York banker) to a beautiful socialite. NOTES: Sequels are Three Smart Girls Grow Up (1939) and Hers To Hold (1943).; Nominated for three prestigious Hollywood awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound Recording.COMMENT: Pleasant enough if rather facile entertainment, no great shakes in the writing department, though it is enlivened by Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Mischa Auer and Ray Milland, who have all the best lines. Winninger stumbles through his poorly written part as best he can, while newcomer Durbin usurps center stage. Her fans will be disappointed she has only three songs, of which only ""Il Bacio"" is handsomely recorded, so perhaps it's just as well. Koster's direction is smooth but not in the least involving. As usual, he relies on his players to do all the work. Production values are otherwise up to scratch. In fact, much of the photography is rather attractive.",1,4,True
tt0028373,Three Smart Girls is a pretty funny movie that served as a nice feature film debut of one Deanna Durbin,7.0,"About 20 years ago, I managed to watch the beginning of this movie on AMC-when it was still commercial-free and didn't edit its films for content-but turned it off or changed the channel after Deanna Durbin's first number. So now I've seen the whole thing on Netflix DVD and I can honesty say I enjoyed most of it. Initially, I thought the dialogue was being presented too fast for me to understand everything going on but I caught on eventually and warmed to Ms. Durbin's presence as the young impulsive teen. The women who play her sisters are also pretty appealing and there's a nice comic performance by Charles Winninger as their father. Mischa Auer is also funny as a drunken bum who's supposed to pose as a count. While I don't consider myself an opera fan, Ms. Durbin is pretty entertaining when she sings. In summary, Three Smart Girls is a pretty funny movie that's worth a look.",3,3,False
tt0028373,Dazzling feature debut for Deanna Durbin,8.0,"Deanna Durbin really did save Universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio. By the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at Universal eg Milestone, Browning and Wyler had gone. Only James Whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short ""Every Sunday"" and initially Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in ""Three Smart Girls"". When Garland was unavailable Universal switched to Durbin. Initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster the film had a European touch.The film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in ""Switzerland"". The ""three smart girls"" of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Grey), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to ""My Heart is Singing"". All is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's stern mother in ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1941).Donna is a gold-digger who, along with her scatty mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no film experience Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture. When she sings ""Someone to Care for Me"" to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father consoles her with ""I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow"", she replies ""Oh I can see enough monkeys around here""!!!With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a ""count"" (Mischa Auer)to romance Donna. They arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the count and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!!!) The plan backfires as he falls for Kay and Donna wants to hasten her marriage to Judson.Penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away. She is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of ""Il Bacio"" (she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with their mother (Nella Walker) sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime Donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count (Mischa Auer) and sails off to Australia with him.Highly recommended.",3,3,True

This is light entertainment at its very best, funny warm and very charming throughout. A great example of the polished production values and tight editing so effortlessly delivered back in the day.

I was laughing out loud at many of her lines. Charles Winninger showed his Vaudevillian chops as the girls father.

I thought Durbin might be precocious and irritating, but instead I left the film understanding why she had such appeal.The screwball set up involves the three young girls of the title heading to New York to stop their father from falling into the clutches of a society lady and her gold-digging mother and instead come back home to patch up his marriage to their mother. Along the way, there's a mistaken identity sub-plot involving Ray Milland and Mischa Auer that plays like something out of ""Three's Company.""""Three Smart Girls"" received three Oscar nominations at the 1936 Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Original Story, and Best Sound Recording.Grade: A-",1,1,False

The daughters find an ethically challenged drunk to charm their father's fiancé away from him, but he's too drunk to do the job. So Ray Milland stumbles into the role, happily taking on the job of seducing the father's fiancé and leading her on, because in reality he wants to impress and seduce one of the daughters.The weirdest scene is when Ray Milland and Deanna Durbin get into an argument in a park. Ray Milland shakes Deanna Durbin so violently that a key she's hiding in her bra falls out. A cop walk up to them and ... arrests Ray Milland? Of course not.

tt0027367,Graphic Study of Nativist Violence,7.0,"At the time it came out Black Legion came from the B Picture Unit at Warner Brothers. Some of the players in it became A list stars later on. Nevertheless this was playing the second half of double features when first released. But it made a tremendous impact and viewing it almost 70 years later, still makes an impact.Warner Brothers as the working class studio was the only one who could have made a film like Black Legion. Working class stiff Humphrey Bogart gets passed over for a promotion at a job, losing it to Polish American Henry Brandon. This makes him ripe for the propaganda of a nativist crew of nightriders who call themselves The Black Legion.Another co-worker Joe Sawyer gets Bogart to join with a whole lot of bad consequences for just about every principal player in the cast.Since this film was about ordinary people it had a great message to tell. We've had nativist outbreaks in America through out our history. The Twenties and Thirties with groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Legion were particularly bad. Bad economic times usually bring out either the best or the worst in people.Humphrey Bogart is joined by a whole bunch of people from his film debut in The Petrified Forest. Joe Sawyer, Dick Foran, Paul Harvey, Eddie Acuff, it must have seemed like a reunion film. For me this has always been Joe Sawyer's career role for the screen. In The Petrified Forest he was one of Bogey's gang. Here he's the evil influence on Bogart, a nice reversal. He had a similar part in San Quentin.Dick Foran is the Mercutio/Benvolio part here, the good friend to Bogart. He was actually a bigger name than Bogey at the time this was made, as he was starring in a bunch singing cowboy films for Warner Brothers. This was one of the few times he was show he could do more than he was usually given.Films back then had a whole lot of stern father figures like Lionel Barrymore and Lewis Stone who could deliver lectures like no other.

But here's the catch: it's not a ""thinly veiled"" swipe at the KKK. It's about the actual, real-life Black Legion. I know; you've never heard of it. Neither did I, until I was cleaning out the stack of magazines in our Indiana farmhouse. Let's hear it for hoarding, because there it was, as large as one of those Life Magazines - a profile on ...the Black Legion. I was horrified, but it did exist: ""The Black Legion was a secret vigilante terrorist group and a white supremacist organization in the Midwestern United States that splintered from the Ku Klux Klan and operated during the Great Depression of the 1930s. According to historian Rick Perlstein, the FBI estimated its membership ""at 135,000, including a large number of public officials, possibly including Detroit's police chief."" In 1936 the group was suspected of assassinating as many as 50 people according to the Associated Press.[1]The white paramilitary group was founded in the 1920s by William Shepard in east central Ohio in the Appalachian region, as a security force named the Black Guard in order to protect Ku Klux Klan officers.[2][3] The Legion became active in chapters throughout Ohio. One of its self-described leaders, Virgil ""Bert"" Effinger, lived and worked in Lima, Ohio.""So why is there so little in our history books about it? It was a relatively short lived hate group, but it showed up in other places: ""Hollywood, radio and the press responded to the lurid nature of the Legion with works that referred to it. Legion of Terror (1936) starred Ward Bond and Bruce Cabot, and was based on this group. Black Legion (1937), a feature film, starred Humphrey Bogart. True Detective Mysteries, a radio show based on the magazine of the same title, broadcast an episode on April 1, 1937 that referred directly to the Black Legion and Poole's murder. The radio show The Shadow, with Orson Welles in the title role, broadcast an episode on March 20, 1938, entitled ""The White Legion""; it was based loosely on the Black Legion. Malcolm X and Alex Haley collaborated on the leader's The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965); he noted the Legion as being active in Lansing, Michigan where his family lived. Malcolm X was six when his father died in 1931; he believed the father was killed by the Black Legion. The TV series History's Mysteries presented an episode about the group entitled ""Terror in the Heartland: The Black Legion"" (1998).I realize I haven't written much about the movie; others have done that well.

tt0027367,A good one,8.0,"Humphrey Bogart is first-rate in this thinly disguised story of the Ku Klux Klan and how it plays on the fears and prejudices of the poor and uneducated (and how it's run by the well-to-do and educated, a point often missed by reviewers). Bogart plays a factory worker who was expecting a promotion, only to see it go to a ""foreigner"" (in this case, a Pole--and, by implication, a Jew, which is where the Klan gets involved). Angry, resentful and worried about his future, Bogart gets caught up in a racist, Klan-like group called the Black Legion, which, in the manner of all fundamentalist right-wing terrorist groups, proclaims its patriotism and its ""defense of God and country"" against ""dirty foreigners."" The interesting thing about this film is that it really doesn't blame Bogart's character for what eventually happens; he's just a pawn in the political agenda of the right-wing business and political interests who actually control the group. Warner Bros. was known for its muckraking films, and this is one of its better ones. It took guts for Warners to make this type of picture during this particular period in American history; there was a strong resurgence of Ku Klux Klan activity all over the country--there was even a Klan parade, with thousands of hooded marchers, that passed directly in front of the White House in Washington, DC--and lynchings and racial murders were skyrocketing, especially in the South. While maybe not as strong as some would have liked, the picture still radiates the Warner Bros. passion for the underdog, and they did a good job here.

In this film Bogey's character, Frank Taylor, moves from a happily married family man, to a man filled with hate and finally to a man remorseful for the trouble he has brought upon himself and others.When Frank Taylor loses an expected promotion to a ""foreigner"", he becomes disillusioned and is coerced by a co-worker (Joseph Sawyer) into joining a secretive hate and Klu Klux Klan like organization called The Black Legion. Despite pleas from his wife (Erin O'Brien-Moore) and best friend (Dick Foran), Taylor continues his terrorist activities leading to the inevitable tragic consequences.The subject of prejudice and hate organizations in a major studio production was quite daring for the 30s, given the introduction of the Production Code only a few years earlier.

tt0027367,"""What this country needs is bigger and better patriots.""",8.0,"As if to counterpoint the darker drama to follow, the initial scene of ""Black Legion"" opens to a factory setting with it's workers all dressed in bright white uniforms, with names neatly embroidered over each man's left pocket. Contrast that with the black anonymity of hooded members of the titled organization, and you have Warner Brothers take on another facet of injustice in pre-war America.Humphrey Bogart portrays Frank Taylor, a disaffected employee passed over for a promotion to a book reading, intelligent Polish worker. While his work suffers his ego simmers, ripe for the pseudo intellectual babble of a disembodied voice on the radio clamoring for the rights of native white American workers. When the time is right, fellow employee Cliff Summers (Joe Sawyer) introduces Frank to an organization known as the Black Legion, championing the rights of workers, while engaging in night time raids on those they wish to eliminate. Taylor's induction into the Legion is conveyed with the utmost symbolism, vowing an oath to the death to protect it's secrets, while a gun points to his head to insure his allegiance.Taylor's involvement with the group comes at the expense of his family, wife Ruth (Erin O'Brien Moore) and son Buddy (Dickie Jones). They attempt to keep him honest, as does friend Ed Jackson (Dick Foran), but before long, Taylor is in so deep he no longer recognizes himself. As Jackson learns of his friend's involvement in the group's local hostilities, the situation reaches a boiling point for Frank, and the legion kidnaps Ed for a traditional whipping. It's Taylor's own handgun that cuts Ed down as he attempts to break free, putting Frank over the edge and setting him up for capture by the authorities. As newspaper headlines proclaim ""Jackson Killing Bares Black Legion"", Taylor faces threats of harm to his family if he testifies against them while in jail.In a scene reminiscent of James Cagney's breakdown at the end of ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", Bogey's character erupts a confession while on trial, bringing down the participants in his crime and exposing the Legion's secrets. In a follow up scene, the entire leadership of the organization involved in Jackson's murder stand trial and are sentenced to life in prison. The textbook speech by the judge (Samuel S. Hinds) to the defendants is a resounding affirmation of the American right to freedom and opportunity.The Warner Brothers films of the era did a good, if sometimes melodramatic job of presenting the ills of society in an unfavorable light. More noted for their crime and gangster dramas, they also keyed in on the effects of poverty (1937's ""Dead End"") and wildcat truckers (1940's ""They Drive by Night""); it seems there wasn't a subject they wouldn't touch.

Bogart is fine in an early role as  a young worker, dismayed at a Polish worker getting a promotion he was seeking, who joins the Klan (or the Black Legion as they call it here).  It's interesting to see him before he was typecast as the tough guy - he is very vulnerable here but not entirely sympathetic.The film wears its sincerity on its sleeve a bit and is never wholly believable, but it is a brave attempt to confront the racism that was rife in Depression era America, when getting and keeping a job was very tough.",20,26,False

But considered purely as popular entertainment, it's pretty striking, with Bogart's performance hovering just this side of 'over the top' -- an amazingly youthful-looking Bogart, in comparison to his later starring roles...The issue of anti-immigrant prejudice has of course taken on new life of late -- if ever it really left -- and Bogart portrays convincingly how the man on the street can become sucked into an otherwise preposterous world of blood-curdling oaths and death's-head regalia, at first through petty personal grudge and then through the surge of power that comes with group action. He depicts with equal conviction the disintegration of the man who finds himself pinned between that same power and what really matters in his life, and Erin O'Brien-Moore is excellent in the role of the wife whom another actress might have represented as too perfect to be true.And the anti-feelgood ending still comes as a shock, after all these years. Justice is even-handed but implacable.The message isn't always terribly subtle, the music likewise, and the acting occasionally veers a little too far into bravura territory, vindicated by a reassuring speech to the effect that actually, no matter what you may have seen in this movie, Americans are inherently nice, tolerant people (just in case the audience might feel bad about themselves, presumably) -- but it's a brave attempt at covering contemporary events, despite the standard disclaimer, and still stands up pretty well as a film in its own right seventy years later.

tt0027367,Americanism or Nazism?,10.0,"Very grim & powerful tale of white supremacy, bigotry & racial hatred, violence, tragedy & social injustice. Still relevant today & probably always will be with these international terrorist groups & the Ku Klux Klan. Too many cultural differences for us to accept & understand one another. Also a rare opportunity to see a very young Humphrey Bogart in an outstanding leading role. The Black Legion's terrorist activities are barbaric & uncivilized but very justifiable in Depression Era America when jobs were virtually impossible to find, when there was work you would go to any extremes to keep & protect your job. The Legion at times resembles Hitler & the Nazis. An excellent thought provoking drama with a bold message that still resonates today. Unquestionably Bogart's best role of the 1930's. The National Board Of Review named Humphrey Bogart as best actor & voted ""Black Legion"" as their favorite movie of 1937.Bogart had 2 screen persona's, first the gangsters that made him famous in films like Dead End & The Roaring Twenties & then the anti-hero that made him a star in The Maltese Falcon & Casablanca. By the late 1940's Bogart also proved to be a very capable actor as well in films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (perhaps his greatest role)& in the 1950's with The African Queen & The Caine Mutiny. However Bogart's first successful ""acting"" role dates back to 1936 when he was given a very demanding leading role of Frank Taylor in Black Legion.Rarely was Bogie given quality leading roles in the 30's for in 1936 the only credentials he had of notable significance was his enormously sensational stage & screen role of Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. His first major success. Bogie was chosen for the lead in Black Legion because Warner Bros needed an actor that looked ""American"" due to it's controversial subject matter. Edward G.Robinson & Paul Muni looked too ethnic & foreign & James Cagney & Spencer Tracy looked too Irish so the studio had no other choice but to give the role to Humphrey Bogart for which he turned in a magnificent performance. Bogie looked very American.Black Legion attracted enormous public & media attention in 1937. Both the film & Bogart received tremendous critical acclaim. One critic wrote ""Bogart is absolutely exhilarating to watch"". Another critic wrote ""Bogart should be considered for the role of Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind"". Critics believed Black Legion would catapult Bogie to stardom & this movie was also in the top 10 list of best films of 1937. Black Legion received an academy award nomination for best original screenplay. But despite all the excitement this movie generated in 1937 it did not elevate Bogart to stardom, despite the success of Black Legion the major stars would outgross him every time. It would be 5 more years until Bogie hit pay dirt again with High Sierra.Perhaps the reason for the ongoing Bogart mystique & phenomenon is that he was already famous before he became a ""movie star"". Black Legion is as good as any film Bogie did later if not better. The most chilling scene is the initiation ceremony ritual showing Bogart on his knees joining the Black Legion while a hooded member points a gun to his head. When Black Legion was first being sold the studio promoted the film by saying ""there is no Robinson or a Muni in the film but there is Humphrey Bogart"". This movie will blow you away!!

This is an old story and the reaction today is much the same as it was then: anger and frustration, leading to a loss of self-esteem and sometimes to criminal behaviour. Fortunately, thugs who engage in lynchings and beatings are no longer on the loose.In some ways, Frank is the hero as well as one of the villains since it is his testimony that puts members of the Black Legion behind bars. The sermonette delivered by the judge is full of platitudes by a character who never had to worry about his own position or status. The movie seems to deliver a message that says ""watch out and don't become like him, if you know what's good for you.""

tt0027367,A very strong message.,8.0,"""Black Legion"" was a very unusual role for Humphrey Bogart, but I think he got it because he was not yet an established star and Warner Brothers put him in many different sorts of parts. So, if you are looking for the tough and assertive sort of Bogart, this is NOT the film for you! No, Bogie plays a despicable sort of jerk--and a cowardly one at that.The film begins at a machine shop. It seems that someone is going to be promoted to foreman and Bogart is sure it will be him. However, a Polish-American worker gets the job instead. While this man DID deserve it, Bogie is sullen and angry--and soon jumps at an opportunity to join a local hate club. The Black Legion is sort of like the KKK with its trappings but is more anti-foreigner in focus. So, to get back at the foreman, Bogart sicks his new 'friends' on them and he soon gets the job promotion. Where does all this new power lead him? See this powerful film and find out for yourself.While I wish the film had taken a stronger and clearer stand against the Klan, it is a very powerful film for 1937, as many folks would have supported groups like the Legion. Groups like the American Bund and the popularity of antisemitic celebrities like Charles Lindburgh and Henry Ford (who wrote books espousing hatred of Jews, foreigners and the like) during this time could not be denied. In other words, this film might have alienated many potential viewers and the studio chose to take a deliberate stand for what is right. And, it's a strong film with a very good performance by Bogart in a VERY different sort of role. Well worth seeing--and probably a bit stronger in its message than the studio's ""Storm Warning""--another anti-hate group film that was made a dozen years later.",15,15,False

The film also stars Dick Foran and Ann Sheridan.Bogart plays Frank Taylor, a husband and father who expects to get a promotion at the auto plant where he works. It goes instead to a young, hard-working man named Dombrowski. When Frank doesn't get the job, he's furious. That night on the radio he hears the head of the Black Legion railing against foreigners taking American jobs, and he decides to join them.The Black Legion, of course, is the Ku Klux Klan, with the sheets and the whole deal. Their methods are brutal - fires, flogging, beatings, etc.It appears all you needed was a foreign last name to qualify as a victim of this group. Back in the '20s and '30s, Italians, Irish, and other immigrant groups could only get menial jobs like sweeping floors, the prejudice against them was so great.It was quite a forward step to make a film about this back in 1937, and it's a good one. Bogart at the time was about 37, and we're so used to seeing him older that he looks like a baby here. He's terrific as a loving father and husband who becomes a new, violent person under the influence of the Legion. He loses more than he gains. It's a great example of how easily people can find a scapegoat for their troubles.Ann Sheridan has a supporting role -- she's very young but recognizable from her voice! Good movie.",14,15,False

And then the scene with the Legion leaders, caring only for money, and not a whit of concern for ideology. Is that a warning to Depression-era middle classes not to trust seemingly populist organizations like lodges and unions? Just wondering. Anyway Bogart and the rest of the cast were quite good, but I found the movie preachy and condescending.",5,15,True

The introduction concludes with the sentence ""But the good journalist must recognize in Fascism certain ancient virtues of the race, whether or not they happen to be momentarily fashionable in his own country. Among these are Discipline, Duty, Courage, Glory, Sacrifice."" In 1936, there was a serious attempt by the capitalist hierarchy to overthrow the government of Roosevelt with a military coup to be led by a popular Marine general, Smedley Butler. The coup only failed because Butler turned on his backers, much as Frank turns on the Black Legion in the movie.This movie only touches on the motives of the sinister organizers of the Black Legion, the gray eminence in suits behind loony dupes like Frank. The implication is that they are just running the Black Legion to make money by selling black sheets and revolvers.

There was a real Black Legion, it did the things we see in this film, and it operated out of the Midwest, but it (and the very broad extent of white supremacy) is not something usually taught in the whitewashed, watered down version of history in American high school level classes, which may have something to do with history repeating itself.This film was made a couple of years after the real-life trial, so while the ideals of America speech may seem laid on pretty thick by the judge in the film, I give it credit for trying to say THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE in response to such ugly domestic terrorist groups, and you can see parallels to that in the struggle for the soul of the country in the current events of today.Obviously, the message of the film, despite how heavy-handed it's delivered, resonates with me. Bogart is also fantastic and wonderfully expressive in his part, so it's must-see for fans of his, and I loved Ann Sheridan in her supporting role even if it's only to add a little lightness to an otherwise heavy script. The film is a little clunky, but I think I'll take the authenticity and relevance of a story like this any day over one that's more artfully done but pushing a dangerously false narrative.

The Legion is right up Taylor's alley, reinforcing his belief that his woes are all the fault of the foreign-born. He gradually gets more immune to the violence as he gets in deeper and deeper with the Black Legion. It really is a very good vehicle for Bogart's acting talent as his morality gradually unwinds.

They ground out message movies by the score during the Great Depression and during and after World War II. They were fast and artless.In this one, a little more emphatic than most, Humphrey Bogart is a happily married factory worker. He's good at his job. Everyone likes him. And when there is an opening for a new foreman, it's assumed that he'll get the promotion. He doesn't get it. ""Dombrowski"" gets it.Dombrowski is an interesting character. Played by the handsome and gay Henry Brandon -- who went on to play Scar in ""The Searchers"" -- he's a genuinely nice guy too. When the guys are shooting the breeze about Bogart's coming promotion, Brandon says, ""He'll make a great foreman."" Brandon gets the job because he puts a little more into his work. He's going to night school and spends his evenings studying instead of listening to radio thrillers or drinking beer with the rest of the fellas. He lives on a chicken farm with his immigrant Pop. His ethnicity is never mentioned.I'm going to have to skim over the slightly intricate plot. It's enough to say that Bogart becomes embittered, joins an organization called The Black Legion that looks a lot like the KKK, and winds up murdering Dick Foran, his best friend, the son of an Irish immigrant who subscribes to ""da Roman hierarchy"". The Legionnaires are all arrested and sent off to spend their lives in the slams, Bogart included.Seeing it now, in our current political climate, one of its most impressive elements is the argument presented by the leaders of The Black Legion. The immigrants are taking over. They're introducing alien ideologies, stealing American jobs, undermining the welfare of good Americans. The air was filled with bumper sticker slogans, as it is now. The hatred is incandescent.Happily, no explanation of the Legion or its members' motives is offered. ""Happily"" because there really isn't any. Social scientists have a variety of theories, ranging from the simple to the complex, but nobody really knows why these outbreaks of collective paranoia and aggression take place -- and they DO take place more or less regularly.In America, prohibition (1919 - 1933) was in part an expression of anger against the Germans who were our foes in World War I and against the second wave of immigrants from central and southern Europe, for whom alcohol was not only not a sin but a ritualized part of both everyday and spiritual life. And who ran the breweries? Schlitz, Blatz, Anheuser-Busch, Pabst, Coors, Budweiser, Schaefer, Ruppert, Hamm. Notice anything about that list? We couldn't send them back but we could make 'em suffer.As the protagonist, Bogart follows Archie Mayo's direction, hits his marks, and says his lines. So does everyone else. Bogart's performance seems the least rushed, the least perfunctory, and Ann Sheridan's stands out as well. The writing doesn't sparkle but the message is clear and the story gripping, and that's enough to hold the film together. I don't know that the message will get through though. Most of us may sit back and shake our heads at how irrational the good folks were, way back there in 1937.

Some of the bigger shots are copied right from lithographs of the period. But then most of the politics is totally fraudulent. Women extras were not allowed to appear in dangerous situations in '30s Hollywood so watch closely during the street scenes where there are runaway horses and racing fire engines. The ""ladies"" scrambling around are clearly tall men in Victorian drag. It's a hoot.Those viewers of a certain age may remember a Sunday evening TV program in the '50s with Walter Kronkite called ""You Are There"" which put you into historical events. The episode featuring the Chicago Fire cannibalized this Fox film and lifted much of the disaster footage.There are so many parallels to the previous year's big MGM success ""San Francisco"" (1936) with Clark Gable and Jeanette McDonald. Here we have Alice Faye also singing in a saloon, a disaster during the night, ""dirty politics"" with an attempt to clean out the slum zone, little kids in danger during the fire, buildings being dynamited to contain the blaze, the hero searching for days for his lost love among the victims, and so forth.",33,35,False

""Little Miss Alice Faye,"" (as Martha says) plays Power's love interest, a dance hall girl. All of the performances are good, the threesome of Power-Ameche-Faye being a great combination that works well here and in ""Alexander's Ragtime Band.""

tt0029047,The Fire That Destroyed Chicago,9.0,"IN OLD CHICAGO (20th Century-Fox, 1937/38), directed by Henry King, is a prestigious production inspired by MGM's SAN FRANCISCO (1936) climaxed by the earthquake that destroyed the city in 1906, thus, the birth of natural disaster films. Headed by the youthful trio of Tyrone Power, Alice Faye and Don Ameche, all with only a few years into the movie business, it is veteran actress Alice Brady, best known for her scatterbrained society matrons of numerous comedies, who stands out with her change of pace characterization. Also playing against type is musical star Alice Faye in a rare dramatic performance. With her name on the marquee, one would assumed this to be a turn-of-the-century Technicolor musical. Granted, it's a dramatic story with some doses of comedy and production numbers, but no Technicolor, which would have benefited with its lavish sets and periodic costumes. IN OLD CHICAGO can be best summed up as a fictionalized story of the O'Leary Family, a ""strange tribe,"" and the events leading to the big Chicago fire of 1871.The story opens with a prologue as the O'Leary's traveling on wagon train bound for new beginnings. After racing alongside a passing train just for the fun of it, Patrick (J. Anthony Hughes) meets with an accident that kills him, leaving his wife, Molly (Alice Brady) to rear her three boys (Gene Reynolds, Billy & Bobs Watson) alone. After burying her husband in the plains, the O'Leary's move on, coming to Chicago where Molly earns money washing laundry and settling her family in the slum area known as ""the Patch."" Moving forward, Molly's boys grow into handsome young men: Jack (Don Ameche), a crusading attorney who's later elected mayor of Chicago; Bob (Tom Brown), the youngest who earns a living driving the family laundry wagon and marrying Gretchen (June Storey), one of his mother's helpers; and Dion (Tyrone Power), a gambler and saloon keeper whose ambitious ways leads him to corruption. Of Molly's three sons, Dion is her biggest concern. She disapproves of his love for Belle Fawcett (Alice Faye), a cabaret singer (""what a woman!"") whose involved with Gil Warren (Brain Donlevy), a corrupt political boss who rivals Dion. Situations become complex after Jack learns how his smooth operating brother got him into office but determined to make good at his job, and Dion's methods in using Belle for his own ambitious ways.With the story of secondary importance and the Chicago fire the main event, the added attraction of musical numbers featured include: ""I've Taken a Fancy to You"" (sung by chorus) by Sidney Clare and Lew Pollack; ""Carry Me Back to Old Virginny"" (sung by Alice Faye) by James A. Bland; ""In Old Chicago"" (sung by Faye) by Mack Gordon and Harry Revel; ""I'll Never Let You"" (sung by Faye); and ""Take a Dip in the Sea"" (sung by Tyler Brooke).Theatrically released at close to two hours (112 minutes), IN OLD CHICAGO was a top-grossing film of the day, and it shows. It's popularity lead to a 1943 reissue cut down by twenty minutes. Since then, the 94 minute edition became the one available to commercial and later cable television markets (American Movie Classics and Fox Movie Channel), as well as video cassette in the 1990s, with the missing material believed to be lost and gone forever. Then around 2002, those missing scenes lifted from IN OLD CHICAGO were discovered and restored to now close to its original play length onto DVD in 2005. The restoration consists the O'Leary family gathered together and praying over the father's grave before continuing on their journey to Chicago; a lengthy courtroom sequence of Jack's first case as a lawyer defending a man (Paul Hurst) with a woman (Thelma Manning) on the witness stand who turns out to be his wife, thus having the judge dismissing the case on the grounds that ""a wife cannot testify against her husband,"" followed by Dion introducing Belle to Jack as they exit the courthouse. The DVD package also features the abridged version on the flip side that had been overexposed on television for decades. In the 1950s, IN OLD CHICAGO was televised as the basis of a one hour show ""City in Flames"" from ""20th Century Fox Hour"" (1957), an episode that premiered on the Fox Movie Channel in 2002.Andy Devine, Sidney Blackmer, Phyllis Brooks and Berton Churchill take part in a long list of supporting players. Any similarity between SAN FRANCISCO and IN OLD CHICAGO is purely intentional. The disastrous climax lasts about 20 minutes; the characters of Clark Gable and Tyrone Power are ambitious and loved by singers (Jeanette MacDonald and Alice Faye); both have a third party who takes an interest in the couple (priest Spencer Tracy and brother Don Ameche); and following the natural disaster, both leading men are seen roaming around with a steak of blood down his face. Regardless of similarities, both films became blockbuster hits.Did Mrs. O'Leary's cow actually start the Chicago fire? One thing for certain, the Chicago disaster of 1871 is as part of American history as the motion picture itself, fact or fiction, being associated with cinema history.

Then we're treated to one of the best fire sequences ever shown on screen--long before the aid of computer technology. If only the rest of the picture had been able to match the fire! Faye is given some over-the-top costuming which cheapens her overall appearance to such an extent that it's hard to see why she's the main attraction for Ameche and Power. Power was still at the pretty boy stage of his good looks and his acting had not quite jelled when he did this role. The fight sequence between him and Ameche is well handled though. Ameche simply fades into the background as the good brother.Faye was said to be pleased with the fact that she was given a more dramatic role for a change. Unfortunately, not much can be said with what she did with this opportunity. Alice Brady is up to the demands of her role as the O'Leary mother who wants her sons to make their mark in the world.However, the film comes to life only for the final twenty minutes or so of fire.

tt0029047,Monotonously rancid and calculated,,"""In Old Chicago"" was Fox's glossy response to MGM's disaster epic ""San Francisco"". As in that enervating hokum, it mixes a weak, absurdly leaden romance with lavish special effects against a grand historical backdrop. In ""San Francisco"", it was the Earthquake of 1906. ""In Old Chicago"", it was the Great Fire of 1871 in Chicago. Director Henry King was one of the most gifted craftsmen of Old Hollywood in classics such as ""State Fair"", ""One More Spring"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", and ""The Gunfighter"", but here the direction is monotonously rancid and calculated. There is a sense that King is not in control of his material, even though it features his recurring preoccupation with Americana. Don Ameche and Tyrone Power are Mrs. O'Leary's two rival brothers. Ameche decides to run for mayor while Power remains a reckless rogue. Alice Faye, who had such a luminous, lively presence in Fox's spirited musicals of 1937 - ""On the Avenue"", ""You Can't Have Everything"", ""Wake Up and Live"" - here gives a weak and fairly dull performance as the showgirl and Power's love interest. Power too gives a lifeless performance. Ameche looks OK, though he too deserved better. If you want to see a better and more convincing piece of Americana with the same stars and director King, I highly recommend the glorious ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"".",4,14,False
tt0029047,Big Shouldered Bore,3.0,"People talk about the strengths of Golden Age cinema, and I believe in them, too, but watching ""In Old Chicago"" is to be reminded of the weaknesses:Thin characterizations. Overtly posed close-ups. Clichéd dialogue. Strained humor. Implausible romances. Improbable coincidences.It's all there in this early disaster movie, which depending on the version you see is either 100 minutes or 70 minutes of windy exposition followed by 25 minutes of fiery, building-crushing spectacle when the Great Fire of 1871 roars through Chi-town, courtesy of Mrs. O'Leary's cow.Alice Brady won an Oscar playing the legendary Mrs. O'Leary, though her solid performance only looks stellar compared to the rest of the cast. History tells us it wasn't her cow that caused the fire, yet this cinematic retelling has Mrs. O at the heart of everything having to do with old Chicago, with one son (Don Ameche) an earnest reformer and another (Tyrone Power) the corrupt power behind the throne. Their father died foreseeing a time when the O'Learys would ""put their mark"" on the city, and this they do, even before they burn it to cinders.The two O'Leary boys have this habit of coming to blows often but then reuniting very earnestly, facing the camera with happy smiles and declarations of sudden unity.As they often say in this movie: ""We O'Learys are a strange tribe."" ""Strange"" doesn't cover it.Power's character, Dion O'Leary, falls hard for saloon singer Belle Fawcett, whose job gives Alice Faye plenty of excuses for dressing up and delivering a series of hokey musical numbers. Dion pleads his case with Belle by wrestling her to the floor and ignoring her pleas to let him go until she returns his kisses passionately. Being he's Tyrone Power, this might even work. But could anyone get away with lines like his ""We've fought, and maybe we'll go on fighting, but we'll do it – together!""Power does get credited for shedding his pretty-boy persona later in his career with harrowing war service and some tougher parts, but here he's all dimple-cheeked smiles and goo-goo eyes. Even when the script has him backstabbing nominal villain Brian Donlevy (really not that bad a guy compared to Dion through most of the film, though presented here as someone to root against only because he's played by Donlevy), Power can't muster up enough gas to make his skullduggery convincing.There's a tonal problem with the film. Director Henry King seems split between whether to make ""In Old Chicago"" a drama, a comedy, or a musical, so he tries for a bit of each, sometimes in tandem. The result is odd bits of pathos like Father O'Leary's death crammed up next to a scene where a fat woman is dropped in a mud puddle. Only in the last 20 minutes, when it becomes a full-fledged disaster film, does it find focus, and then only as spectacle with powerful scenics, like people walking on rooftops dwarfed by the fires raging behind them, or buildings raining masonry on the heads of fleeing victims.The focus on the O'Learys remains, however, as tired and improbable as ever, with Brady and Power left to deliver some final lines to the camera about Chicago emerging stronger and better from this disaster. It's all such hooey you almost wish for a lingering piece of masonry to tumble down upon them. But then someone would have to make still another speech about how they didn't die in vain, and then ""In Old Chicago"" would never end.",9,13,True

But by the end we were alternating between groaning and ridiculing it.It had a few good points: First, it was interesting to see Don Ameche as a young actor - who had the same mannerisms and voice as he did in 'Cocoon'.  Second, it had good special effects for 1938.  The explosions and fire looked real enough, although none of it really looked like Chicago.That's about it for the good points, unless you consider the fun we had making fun of it.  The lead actress was one of the worst dancers in movie history - she had the rhythm of Lili Von Shtupp in 'Blazing Saddles' but with even goofier costumes.  Everything was over-the-top dramatic, how many times can they say ""We O'Learys are a strange clan!""?  And the brothers did a lot of making-up for dramatic effect: ""Well that doesn't matter now, as long as we're together again!""

tt0029047,Well It's the Best Film I've Ever Seen About the Great Chicago Fire,7.0,"The historical drama In Old Chicago is directed by Henry King and stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche. The film takes place in 1870s Chicago.The film starts out with a family heading to Chicago in 1854. On the way to Chicago the father decides to race a train after his children ask him to do so and he loses control of the cart and ends up badly injuring himself, so much so it leads to his death. When the remainder of the family enter Chicago two of the children accidentally dirty a woman's dress and the mother offers to clean it for her. The mother is so good as cleaning she starts a business and then it is cut to 1870. All the boys are grown up one is a lawyer, one is involved with gambling and other frowned on affairs, and the final one does not really have that much of a part so it doesn't matter. The son that is a lawyer, Jack (Ameche), is convinced to run for mayor and Dion (Power) is one of the heads of a somewhat crime organization. The two are rivals, but then the great fire starts burning...The writing for this film is decent. It is an interesting concept having the two brothers pitted against each other, I like that part a lot. But every relationship involving a woman of romance just seemed so unnatural and forced. It was just like if anyone talked to a woman in a few minutes they would be in love. I liked towards the end everything that had to do with the fire, I thought that was very interesting and kept my attention. After the film ended though not much was very memorable.Henry King's direction for this film was quite good. One shot in particular I liked was when it was in the bar and the camera dollied backwards and I saw all the bartenders serving beer to the large crowd of people. This shot was so much more efficient than just an overhead shot displaying the large amount of people because it felt like I was actually there. Also King directed everything with the fire brilliantly as well. He got solid performances from all his leads as well.The editing for this film was equally as good as the direction. One thing I liked in particular was when the mother was washing the clothes and all the years passed by over her washing. I thought that was much smarter than just going to the next shot and putting 1870 on the bottom of the screen. Again with the fire scenes everything was edited perfectly, especially involving the special effects.The acting was solid by most of the cast. I thought Tyrone Power played his part very well, he was likable even though his character was devious. I did think the parts where he was with any woman besides his mother were ridiculous, but that wasn't his fault it was the writers and director. Alice Faye did not give that great of a performance but I thought her role was somewhat useless so it was hard for her to be good. Don Ameche basically just read his lines and furrowed his brow during the whole film so nothing remarkable. Alice Brady won an Oscar for her role as the mother and she deserved it. She was basically a caring mother that did not want her sons to be running around and being with women who were not of class. She played the part perfectly and really could not have improved.Overall I give this film a very weak 7/10. My main issue is that after the film I almost immediately forgot it but during the film it was quite an experience. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys historical dramas.",9,12,False

tt0029047,Classy '30s picture,,"""In Old Chicago"" is an entertaining 1930s movie that focuses on the adventures of two brothers who live in the Windy City during the latter portion of the 19th century. One of them runs for mayor of Chicago; the other finds love with a showgirl. The brothers' mother is Mrs. O'Leary, a headstrong woman who makes a living in the laundry business. And it is Mrs. O'Leary's cow that kicked over a lantern in the barn that started the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. That scene is recreated here in brilliant fashion. The special effects are excellent (by 1930s standards), and the sets are marvelous. 19th century Chicago has never looked as good as it does here. The late Don Ameche (Oscar winner for the 1985 fantasy ""Cocoon"") stars in one of his early film roles as the brother who becomes a candidate for mayor of Chicago.

tt0029047,"""Looks like the fire's out""",5.0,"Copycatting and one-upmanship were popular sports among the major studios of classic era Hollywood. In 1936 MGM had had a massive hit with San Francisco, an epic about the city's early days culminating with the infamous 1906 earthquake. The following year Fox sought to mine the same gold with a similarly massive production of fictional drama leading up to the great fire of Chicago.In Old Chicago was also a vehicle for Fox's latest rising star, Tyrone Power. Power is handsome and charismatic but not a great actor. This is a surprisingly ambiguous role for him, verging on villainy more than once. As it happens Power is quite well suited to being dastardly and would have made a good gangster. His best scene is the one where he nonchalantly tells Brian Donlevy he sold him out. Other than that he's just a grinning twit. His co-star Don Ameche on the other hand was a fine dramatic player who really stands out here. It's just a shame Ameche so often missed out on the juiciest roles. Alice Brady is very good too, playing the boys' mother. Unlike most Oscar-winners she doesn't have one ""big"" scene that clinched it, but is throughout full of eye-catching spirit. Also watch out for an uncredited Rondo Hatton, a menacing presence lurking in several scenes.The screenplay is by prolific Hollywood hacks Sonya Levien and Lamar Trotti, based on a story by Niven Busch. It is a rather trite affair, events all slotted together a little too neatly. Very little time is devoted to subplot or character development, and by the picture's climax we do not feel especially attached to these people. Much is made of ""The Patch"" being a district of squalor and vice, but we never see a glimpse of the sordid side of the city, so it remains just an abstract over which the characters bicker but the audience remains indifferent to. Tyrone Power woos his woman in the manner of the era's swashbucklers, basically with a series of persistent assaults and abductions. The screenplay doesn't really give time to the development of a more touching romance. Despite its ambitious scope, the picture runs only a bit over 90 minutes, then a more typical length for a small chamber drama. The brevity of the picture is disappointing and the culprit is a script that needs more padding.The director was among Fox's most respected professionals, the consistently competent veteran Henry King. As usual King places a heavy emphasis on sets and clutter, bringing a rather dark, oppressive look to the picture. Even the opening scene of the pioneer wagon does not conjure up the freedom of the open plain, beginning instead with an almost entirely black shot with the wagon swinging round to fill the frame. This prevents the switch to the tall buildings and narrow streets of the city from being too stark. You could also see King's approach as being a build-up to the fire sequence, in which the claustrophobic shot composition really enhances the sense of panic. Overall however, this is a somewhat lacklustre effort from a usually ace director, lacking the iconic look he brought to State Fair (1933) or the sublimely relaxed pacing of Jesse James (1939).Like San Francisco before it, In Old Chicago fared well at the box office. Power was gaining in popularity, and the sheer scale of the fire scenes counted for something. However, compared to the earlier movie (a bit of a neglected masterpiece, by the way), which it deliberately set out to better, it fails on every level. As always, a timely bandwagon hop can reap quick financial rewards, but it takes more than a simple formula to make a great motion picture.",6,10,False

tt0029047,"This movie isn't on fire. It's lukewarm. I really didn't like it. In Old Chicago has me, heated.",6.0,"Supposedly based off a fake novel 'We're the O'Learys' by Niven Busch; this film was indeed, 20th Century Fox's answer to MGM's disaster hit film 1936's 'San Francisco'. It really did seem to copy, nearly everything from director Woody Van Dyke's movie, from musical dance numbers, love story between a criminal and a singer, political and criminal enterprises sub-plot and a fiery full climax. It even took, the whole idea of singing a song, by the waterside, while watching the city burn, motif. It's nearly a carbon copy. While, this movie was highly successful in its own right, with a Best Picture Oscar nominee, it's not really historic accuracy at all, as well. Directed by Henry King, the film tells the fictionalized account about the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 with the O'Leary family. First off, there is the urban legend spread by the Chicago Tribune newspaper about Mrs. O'Leary's cow starting the brazing fire that burn the city. In truth, it's highly doubtful that the cow set off the fire, due to the fact that the real Mrs. O'Leary was asleep when it started. Also, there is the fact that Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Ahern admitted to reporters, that the original report about a cow kicking off a lantern was false. Most likely, it was related to other wildfires in the Midwest that day due to drought and cause by poor city building techniques, such as wooden shingle roofs having topped with highly flammable tar. Anyways, although Mrs. O'Leary was never officially charged with starting the fire, the story became so engrained in local lore that Chicago's city council officially exonerated her—and the cow—in 1997. However, this later pardon didn't help her at the time, as Anti-Irish attitudes was growing, encouraging many Chicagoans to use the O'Learys as scapegoats. They became one of the most hatred families in America, for a very long time. While, this part of the story isn't the movie's fault, it doesn't help that the movie push the idea that the O'Leary accidentally did it, when the writers: Niven Busch, Sonya Levien, and Lamar Trotti truly knew, that they didn't, even for 1940's historical research standards. The portrayal of the real-life O'Leary family is largely fictitious here, down to the names of the characters being change to fit more with the Busch's novel. I really couldn't get, behind, the idea, that the real-life poor family was now rich, with Mrs. Catherine O'Leary became highly successful, laundry owner, Molly O'Leary (Alice Brady) with two high class boys, Dion (Tyrone Power), a local club owner, and Jack (Don Ameche) who ends up, being the Mayor of Chicago and a third son, Bob (Tom Brown) who really didn't add much to the story. Its stretch too far away from history. In truth, the O'Learys had two children, one son, James Patrick and one daughter, Anna. While, Dion is very similar to the notorious gangster, real-life James Patrick O'Leary; James didn't start running gambling saloons until the late 1890. Also, none of the O'Learys, ever ran for mayor as, the real-life, Chicago mayor at the time, was Roswell B. Mason. Despite that, I think, both Tyrone Power and Don Ameche did alright in their roles, even if Powers was a bit creepy with co-star, Alice Faye as Belle Fawcett. During pre-production, MGM had announced that Jean Harlow, who was under contract to that studio, would be loaned to 20th Century Fox to star in the role Belle Fawcett. However, due to Harlow's untimely death, the part went to Alice Faye. Faye's star power rose as a result of the picture, creating one of the best careers in the Golden Era of Hollywood. She really show that she has the screen-presence, both in the acting and singing. I'm surprise, she wasn't nominated for Best Actress. Well, I think Faye's co-star, Alice Brady did alright with her given role; it's nothing near amazing to the point that she deserve the best actress in a supporting role. It's funny that she never did get it, as Brady wasn't present at the award ceremony, but a man walked up and accepted the award on her behalf. After the show, he and the Oscar were never seen again. Anyways, another problem with this film is the pacing. At close to two hours, (112 minutes) it's one disaster movie that really stretch out. Since then, the 94 minute edition is available for commercial use. Still, the whole beginning scenes were ridiculous. The idea that Mrs. O'Leary's husband, Pat (J. Anthony Hughes) die in the most outrageous way, racing a steam train with a horse in the beginning was horrible. Who thought of that? In truth, he died much, much later due to poor health. I felt the movie spent way too long, exploring the O'Leary's boys' childhoods when it wasn't needed. It really didn't add anything to the rest of the movie. Despite that, the movie does pick up, toward the middle, as the humor, songs, and action kept me, very entertained, even if there is way too many dance numbers to count. Also, the spectacular 20-minute fire sequence in the film's climax (a dangerous sequence filmed on the studio's back lot with 1500 extras and a herd of cattle) was well made, even if the women stunt people were men in drag. At the time of its release, it was one of the most expensive movies ever made. No wonder, why other films like 1948's 'Call Northside 777' & 1976's 'Time Travelers' reused footage from the ending, here to save money. . Yet, I really didn't like the ending. It was sadly, way too cheerily and cheesy. Overall: This Windy City story kinda blows. It's not the worst historical disaster movie, I saw. Yet, it will never be, one of my favorites. In Old Chicago kinda does fizzles off.",6,7,True
tt0029047,The Night Chicago Fried,5.0,"Really, this feature is so close in content to the earlier 1936 disaster movie / musical melodrama smash hit ""San Francisco"" it could have been called ""Oakland"". Like ""S.F."" it concludes with a famous tragic disaster which decimates the city, featuring an extended spectacular special effects sequence and precedes that with a hokey story involving two feuding men, both rivals over ownership of the seedy but profitable entertainment part of town as well as a female nightclub singer, although thankfully this time not of the highbrow operatic style of Jeanette MacDonald, but in the more entertaining low-brow style of Alice Faye.At least the film acknowledges the source of the fire as being caused by Mrs O'Leary's cow but then seeks to build its narrative around the whole family, starting with the sentimental sacrifice of Pa O'Leary just as he's leading his young family to a new life in the old town, the rise of Ma O'Leary's laundry business there and the rise to prominence by different means of her two ambitious sons, one, played by Tyrone Power, who is the shady risk-taker, the other, played by Don Ameche, the straight arrow lawyer and later mayor of the town. There is actually a non-entity third brother too who we briefly see ensconced with his Swedish wife (she complete with bangs in her hair and overdone accent just in case you didn't know) but the main story concerns the rivalry between the two older siblings, Power's ruthless ambition contrasted with Ameche's principled altruism, their relationship strained further when they separately cross swords with established gangster and nightclub owner Gil Warren played with Victorian panto-villain exaggeration by Brian Dunlevy.To be fair, all this is very much grist to the mill, once the fateful cow kicks over the lantern in old Ma's barn setting off a conflagration which soon enflames the whole timber-built poor section of the city the men are feuding about and the SFX used are very effective indeed. Naturally the great fire creates tragedy for the central family but at least it serves to straighten up bad boy Tyrone as his old mum gets to her feet at the end to proclaim that the city will rise again, never mind that it was her negligence which saw it rased to the ground in the first place.The backstory here is very hackneyed indeed despite the best efforts of an enthusiastic Power, Ameche and Faye, however, how Alice Brady got an Oscar for her terrible acting as the family matriarch is beyond my ken. Director Henry King certainly does a fine job of recreating the spectacle of the fire but before that his work is slapdash and slipshod.A huge hit on original release it was probably a relief to cinema-goers that there were no other natural or man-made city-destroying disasters in recent American history for Hollywood to dramatise as this one, in the wake of the superior ""San Francisco"", certainly took the sub-genre down a notch or two in quality.",5,6,False
tt0029146,"Fine acting, poor history",7.0,"I highly recommend ""The Life of Emile Zola"" for the brilliant performances of Paul Muni, Gale Sondergaard, and Joseph Schildkraut.  (Although I still must admit I'm surprised by Schildkraut's Oscar victory...although he certainly does a good job as Alfred Dreyfus, the role doesn't really give him much opportunity to demonstrate his talents.  Dreyfus is not shown in any depth; his role consists almost entirely of protesting his innocence and languishing in prison.)Strong performances aside, though, I do have some problems with the film. It strikes me as very odd that a film that makes such a big deal about ""the truth"" is so hesitant at actually depicting it.  One of the key issues of the Dreyfus affair, anti-semitism, is never even brought up.  The only reference to Dreyfus' Judaism is a passing glimpse on his personnel papers. The filmmakers' reluctance to address such an important part of the story does a disservice to history.",42,52,False
tt0029146,"May my name be forgotten, if Dreyfus is not innocent.. He is innocent.",8.0,"In 1937, The Life of Emile Zola was nominated for the largest number of awards, ten. The movie won three including Best Picture. However, sadly and in some ways shamefully, this film has been ridiculed for being dated today, it's ways and means a little obsolete, and it's style rather unusual. That is downright unjust! The style which is portrayed in this remarkable seventy year old film is quite conventional. The dialogue is perhaps overwritten, but the powerful story is there, and the story line is enhanced by intelligent dialogue to say the least, as well as, first rate performances by an excellent cast, preferably Paul Muni (giving possibly his best performance) as Emile Zola and supported well by Joseph Schildkraut as Dreyfus. Not to mention, the film is technically excellent. Editing, costuming, lighting - without doubt, and all the production values stand up beautifully even several decades later.Sure it's a fictionalized version of the life of the great French writer Emile Zola, however, great fiction can make a great film and that is the case with The Life of Emile Zola. One may forget that this film was released in 1937 when anti-Semitism was again sweeping the continent of Europe, and for that very reason, the word ""Jew"" is never mentioned and we are only given a short visual reference. To avoid lawsuits from their descendants, only Major Dort and Major Esterhazy names were specifically identified. Others are referred to as the Chief of Staff, the Minister of War, etc. Also, Dreyfus was not freed and restored to rank in 1902, the year of Zola's death, but in 1906 after being found guilty again in an 1899 retrial. These historical errors can be forgiven, because it's the films message which stands and given the current climate, the movie's message is all the more important.The shifting focus of this film doesn't make it a frustrating experience for modern viewers. In fact, the film flows quite nicely: struggling writer, gets in trouble for his book, then the film follows Zola's success as he becomes a powerful force in society. Eventually we get to 1894, where many claim the film to zoom away from its subject, where the film begins to focus on Dreyfus. With that being said, if you sit down to watch The Life of Emile Zola, don't skip the first third of the movie, because it's every bit as moving and powerful as the dramatic court scene, most notably in the unforgettable self-defense scene in which Muni delivers an outstanding performance.Unfortunately, had Muni not won the previous year for another biopic, The Story of Louis Pasteur, he would have received the Oscar for his portrayal of Zola. Muni was not only nominated for an Oscar for this role but also received awards from many critics groups. Today many dismiss the significant talent of Muni (one of films first devoted actors), however, one cannot deny he had a great deal with elevating the art of film acting.",43,46,False

tt0029146,Still one of the best Hollywood docudramas,,"Handsomely mounted in the Warner Brothers style of the 30's, and topped off with a stirring Max Steiner score, ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (***) remains a passionately engrossing experience.  Refreshingly, the film admits upfront right after the opening titles that it's a fictionalization, something that isn't done nearly as often it should be in today's purportedly ""true story"" docudramas.  (These days, this disclaimer is often buried in the fine print at the very end of the credits after nearly everyone has left the theater.)  Even so, ""Zola"" remains remarkably true to the facts.  It skips lightly over the author's early years in the first 20 minutes and then soars to gripping dramatic heights in the outrageous libel trial that Zola underwent after he published his celebrated ""J'Accuse"" which condemned the hypocrisy and corruption of the military establishment as it falsely accused high-ranking Captain Alfred Dreyfus of treason and then attempted a massive cover-up when it realized it had made a mistake.  The movie has been criticized for underplaying the anti-semitic aspects of the Dreyfus prosecution, but it's implied quite neatly in the scene where the camera pans down Dreyfus's resume to his religion while one of his superiors marvels how ""someone like that"" could became an officer.  The film does indulge in some pretty fancy compression towards the end.  It implies that Dreyfus was reinstated in the Army right after returning from Devil's Island and on the same day as Zola's tragic accidental death.  However, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the real facts are even more disturbing and incredible.  In 1899 after his return, Dreyfus was retried and found guilty again by a court tribunal!  However, he was pardoned by the President.  He was finally cleared of all charges and reinstated in the service in 1906, four years after Zola's death in 1902.  Interesting sidelight:  Zola and his devoted wife had no children but he did carry on a 14-year affair with one of his housemaids that produced 2 children.  I guess there's no way the Warner Brothers were going to complicate the image of their hero as a saintly crusader for truth and justice by including this spicy little domestic tidbit.",35,37,False
tt0029146,"Muni Was A Big, Big Star In The 1930s",4.0,"Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola. Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the ""Golden Age."" Whatever part he played; you were riveted to the screen watching him.Unlike the Pasteur role, I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military, here making it a point to tell us how ""corrupt"" those organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.However, it must be noted the facts support this story. It also does not in any way diminish Zola's accomplishments as a social reformer, getting rid of certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that, than concentrating on one trial.",18,36,False

This movie had ten Oscar nominations, and won best picture in 1938. Paul Muni (The Last Angry Man) was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Émile Zola, one of the foremost writers in France. Zola and his best friend and confident painter Paul Cezanne, played by Russian born actor Vladimir Sokoloff (Taras Bulba, For Whom The Bell Tolls), who attend the Moscow Academy of Dramatic Art. The story takes place in  Paris in 1862.  Paul Cezanne and Émile Zola were friends when both were starting their careers. Through ups and downs Zola became financially successful long before Cezanne. He was married and had a successful career as an author. Paul Cezanne then decided to live in the country far away from the city, and told Zola not to be part of the establishment but to fight for truth and justice again.  Émile Zola is living comfortable and even getting fat, and is about to became a member of the French Academy for the utmost writers, and to get honored by the Nobel society. He is approached by  Lucie Dreyfus, played by Gale Sondergaard (Anna and the King of Siam), whose husband was unjustly court martialed and sent to Devil's Island (Papillion's prison home) because he was accused of betraying his country by disclosing military secrets. Mr. Dreyfuss' case is one of those passionate cases where anti-Semitism is also an issue. It is unbelievable that this specially inhumane trial took place in France,  nation for Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality. That what Zola was fighting for.The music by Max Steiner is beautiful. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best music score. Anatole France is also part of the story. My favorite scenes: the folding umbrellas, Zola getting his first pay check as a best seller author, the conversations between Zola and Paul Cezanne. The determination of Ms. Dreyfuss and she goes to talk to Zola, her last hope. My favorite quotes: ""There are times when the most courageous thing is to be cowardly"". This is a great biography.  It is a Schindler's list type of story!  It has great passion, deep commitments, love, great music, and we get to know a bit more about French literature. Thanks to my dad, who was passionate for literature and majored in languages, I was brought up with a library of books where one could find the internationally acclaimed classics.

tt0029146,"A Well-Crafted, Worthwhile Memorial to Zola",,"This well-crafted film is a worthwhile memorial to Émile Zola, one of the finest writers of his era, and one who deserves to be better-known today outside of his own country. It seems likely that Zola, a naturalistic writer who always used lifelike, genuine characters who had both strengths and weaknesses, would probably have been satisfied with the way he is portrayed by Paul Muni and by the screenplay. Zola is shown not as a flawless hero or as a larger-than-life icon, but as a real person with a talent for writing, who was willing to struggle both to establish himself and to remain true to his principles.The movie makes a good selection of events from Zola's life, looking both at his earlier years, when he was struggling to establish himself, and at his later years, when as a respected member of society he had to fight his own reluctance to remain true to his ideals. The supporting cast have smaller parts, but they generally do quite well. Vladimir Sokoloff has a couple of nice scenes as Cézanne, and his interactions with Muni are quite helpful in defining the main character, especially as he changes once attaining personal success. Joseph Schildkraut makes good use of his scenes as Dreyfus.Zola's lifetime was also an interesting and often tumultuous period in France's own history, and the movie provides at least a small taste of that.There was, for example, even more to the Dreyfus situation than is shown here, but it and other historical events are shown mainly as they involved Zola himself - otherwise, to do justice to the events in themselves, the movie would have had to be several times as long. There's plenty here as it is to make it worthwhile, both as a good drama and as a believable portrait of Zola.",16,21,False
tt0029146,A Wonderful Life of Emile Zola ****,10.0,"Marvelous historical biography of Emile Zola, splendidly played by Paul Muni.Always for the poor person, Zola immerses himself in the Dreyfus Affair. Count Esterhazy, the guilty person, is successfully able to frame Dreyfus for passing secrets to the enemy during the Franco-Prussian War. What hurts the most is that Dreyfus, a high ranking official in the French army, was immediately condemned due to a wave of anti-semitism throughout France.Zola shall fight for the exoneration of Dreyfus all the way. In his famous J'Accuse, he drives this goal into total action.Joseph Schildkraut, as Dreyfus, won the best supporting actor award for his portrayal of the condemned man. You feel his hurt and ultimate triumph through every step of the way. His imprisonment at Devils Island is so realistic. His wife in all this is well played by actress Gale Sondergaard, who shed her usual evil-like performances and turned in a remarkable one as the grief stricken faithful wife of the apparently hopeless Dreyfuss.When Dreyfus is ultimately exonerated, tragedy strikes. Zola dies accidentally from poisonous gas seeping through his home. He may be gone but his legacy would live on.",12,20,False
tt0029146,In Me You See The Honor of France,10.0,"The title for this review is quote I read from Charles DeGaulle discussing the responsibilities he felt in the role that fate thrust upon him. DeGaulle was a military man who stepped up to the plate when his country's fortunes were at their darkest. A whole lot of other more important army figures could have done what he did, but no one stepped to the plate like that courageous if sometimes exasperating junior brigadier general.Another guy who stepped to the plate for France was not a military man, in fact it was the army he took on. The Life of Emile Zola is the story about that man, brought beautifully to life by Paul Muni who was a modern writer who first fought to write life as he saw it and not through some romantic gauze as was popular in the first half of the 19th century. His writings led to a lot of social reform in France.Yet half the film is dedicated to Zola's last struggle, taking up the cause of wrongly convicted Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Joseph Schildkraut won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar of 1937 who when treason was discovered was singled out because he was a Jew as the fall guy.Although Hollywood tends to over-dramatize in many cases this is one where they are telling the absolute truth. I find it hard to fathom myself that even after proof was brought to the French Army's attention that another was in fact the guilty party, they persisted in promoting the fiction about Dreyfus's guilt. Anti-Semitism certainly ran deep in many quarters of French society, the military being only one of them. Keeping faith with prejudice was more important than getting at the truth and getting justice for a wrongly accused man.Muni's address to the court during the libel suit trial the army brought against him is classic. Though many feel his style of acting is outmoded, I for one miss that. I can't think of a player today who could move the audience as Muni did in that address. He was nominated for Best Actor, but he had won that award the previous year for The Story of Louis Pasteur and in 1937 was beaten by Spencer Tracy for Captains Courageous.However The Life of Emile Zola won for Best Picture of 1937 and also won for Best adapted Screenplay. I can't think of better praise to give the film than to say that if Emile Zola could have been interviewed he'd have given the film an enthusiastic rave.France like a lot of countries has had people come to their leadership in an hour of need. In the 15th century it was a peasant girl whom we know as Joan of Arc. During the occupation by the Nazis, France's honor was preserved by Charles DeGaulle. And at a time when corruption and prejudice poisoned the French society, it wasn't a peasant saint or a military leader, but a man of learning and letters who would not give up until truth and justice won out.",12,19,False
tt0029146,Memorable Courtroom Speeches,,"Such occasions are not unlike great arias in operas: the stage lights softly dim and follow spot brightens as all cast characters (and audience) lean forward to focus on the delivery.Such a moment occurs in ""The Life of Emile Zola"" as Paul Muni as Zola steps to the platform to deliver his courtroom defense speech.  Against all the odds of a jeering mob and negative press, he proceeds to offer a seven minute oration.The scene is a set-up for Muni, and the camera, editing, and staging are all designed for the actor to deliver his thespian goods.  He doesn't disappoint.Two other cinematic courtroom speeches are comparable: Alec Guiness as Benjamin Disraeli in ""The Mudlark"" (1950) enjoyed the rare opportunity of having his six minute, uninterrupted speech done in a single, slow tracking shot; and Gary Cooper as Howard Roark in ""The Fountainhead"" (1949) held a courtroom breathless for over five minutes, defending his act of poetic, if not Randian-judicial, justice.In Muni's case, his defense scene turned out to be a highpoint of an intriguing acting career.  From Yiddish theater to worldwide stardom--with fewer that two dozen films to his credit--Muni constantly enthralled some while leaving others doubtful.What's undeniable about Muni is that he achieved stardom on his own power. He was able to convince a goodly number of people, both peers and public alike, that he was indeed not just a good but great actor.;While some held a sneaking suspicion that he was a wee bit of a poseur, having never formally studied his craft, it really doesn't matter.  Muni didn't win his lucrative acting contracts--or his Academy Award honors--for nothing.  Personally, I enjoy his general work, being more partial to roles more close to his own than those of his elders.  In latter cases I felt he often tended to go a bit over-the-top with ""stereotypical mannerisms.""As Zola, though, his earnestness and determination proves convincing, and the film itself is peopled with a powerhouse cadre of Warner Bros. character players.  To the film's credit, a pre-enactment inscription admits to the intermingling of fiction with fact for dramatic purposes.  This also relieves the production of accusations of historical inaccuracy.;All in all, ""The Life of Emile Zola"" is  a most engrossing biopic of a courageous literary giant who placed the pursuit of justice above the receiving of worldly accolades.",18,19,False

I don't know whether I saw this film then or not.Now I find the depiction of ""great writer (Zola) and great painter (Cezanne) in Paris during the 1800s"" to be a grade school or Sunday school version of life.  Hollywood's description of the Dreyfuss affair lacks complexity, sophistication, reality, accuracy.  The true story abounds in dramatic interest, excitement, conflict and power quite beyond the movie's reach.But we do have two marvelous public speeches, one when Muni as Emile Zola is reading his pamphlet, ""I Accuse,"" to his friends and allies.  And the other, when he is defending himself in a hostile court against the charge of having slandered the army.  These alone are worth more than the price of admission.

It was only for love of Paul Muni that I did finish it, otherwise I surely would have turned it off and never turned it back on again. The Life of Emile Zola won Oscars for Best Picture of 1937, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Joseph Schildkraut, who only had about seven minutes of screen time. Paul was nominated for Best Actor, and Max Steiner's lousy music was honored with a nomination as well.I've never been one to sympathize with starving artists, or radical muckrakers, so it's no wonder Emile Zola's life story left me cold. Paul Muni, normally an extremely good-looking man, once again donned tons of age makeup to become unattractive. If you've never seen him in a movie, don't start with this one, otherwise you'll never have a crush on him. The film follows Zola from his youth as he starved in a drafty attic before his writing had been discovered, through his chance meeting with Nana, the prostitute he wrote about in his first book, to his involvement in the accusation of treason of a French officer, Dreyfuss. While he is very convincing as an old man, he doesn't even attempt to put on a French accent, and the script doesn't give him much to do besides shout and complain.As long as I'm talking about the script, it's very uneven and choppy. One life event cuts to another, without any transitional scene to connect them. The dialogue is unrealistic and feels like a first draft. With all the competition that year, In Old Chicago, The Prisoner of Zenda, The Good Earth, The Hurricane, and Lost Horizon, I'm surprised this film was nominated for any awards.",4,18,False

Naturally he was framed by a high-powered French count and it was up to Zola to free him. The film is a genuine biopic that works due to an Oscar-winning screenplay, top-notch direction by the Oscar-nominated William Dieterle and the show-stopping performances of Muni and Schildkraut. High production values and nice cinematography make ""The Life of Emile Zola"" one of the best films of the 1930s.

tt0029146,"Opulent, well-acted and quite enjoyable...but it's missing a very important part of the story!",8.0,"The first quarter of the film is a brief biography of most of the adult life of Zola. That's because the final portion centers on the last years of Zola's life and his attempt to gain Dreyfus his release from prison. Dreyfus had been sent to Devil's Island--convicted of sending French military secrets to foreign powers. Amazingly, when the true perpetrator was learned, the highest officers in the military decided NOT to punish the man responsible and keep Dreyfus in prison so they wouldn't lose face for convicting the wrong man!! I really enjoyed ""The Life of Emile Zola"" though could see that a very important part of the story is missing. I am NOT talking about the film taking a few artistic liberties--I certainly expected that. Instead, I am talking about a deliberate effort by the studio to misrepresent a major part of the story to make it more palatable to the general public. You see, about 3/4 of the movie concerns Zola and the Dreyfus Affair--yet it really makes no real effort to talk about the heart of why Dreyfus was convicted for a crime he clearly did not commit--because he was a convenient scapegoat because he was Jewish. The film BRIEFLY mentions he was Jewish but completely downplays this angle--mostly because I assume they were afraid antisemites in the US and abroad might find this unacceptable. Sadly, it makes this exceptional film just a bit less exceptional.What I liked about the film was the overall quality of the picture. It was well written, acted and just screams quality. Plus, compared to many other biopics of the era, this one is a little more accurate--as the facts of the story are essentially true (though rearranged and interpreted for dramatic effect). Still, I find it hard to believe it won the Oscar for Best Picture--though I must concede that Paul Muni was exceptional.

Still, given the film's reputation (Best Picture Oscar Winner, Leonard Maltin rates it **** in his ""Movies & Video Guide""), I somehow expected a masterpiece - but, personally, I feel that Dieterle's THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1939) are greater achievements. Even so, it's been sometime since I watched a vintage old-style Hollywood film; of late, I've mostly been concentrating on Euro-Cult and World Cinema stuff - but, really, there's no beating the professionalism and sheer entertainment value of a product from the cinema's Golden Age! The film strikes a good balance between Zola's literary career and his struggles for social justice: the latter is mostly devoted to the Dreyfus affair, a veritable cause celebre at the time (cinematically treated two more times in DREYFUS [1931] and I ACCUSE [1958], neither of which I've watched though the latter had turned up some years back on late-night Italian TV!), culminating in one of the finest courtroom scenes ever filmed. Production values are top-notch, the Oscar-winning script appropriately literate (though the constant speechifying and the film's two-hour length - by contrast, LOUIS PASTEUR had been less than 90 minutes but, then, the epic and star-studded JUAREZ was longer still - make for a somewhat heavy-going experience) and Dieterle's handling virtually impeccable; the only unpersuasive aspect, perhaps, is the one-dimensional portrayal of the corrupt French military who callously sent Dreyfus to Devil's Island for treason, and left him there to rot for years - even after they had found absolute proof of his innocence, because that would have meant admitting to a mistake! The cast is filled with wonderful characters actors whose familiarity - and reliability - allows utmost audience involvement every step of the way, despite Hollywood's typically idealized viewing of events. Best of all, naturally, are Muni as Zola (simply brilliant, especially during his show-stopping speech at the trial, and who even ages convincingly!) and Schildkraut (a touching Dreyfus who, in spite of his relatively brief appearance, managed to walk off with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar - though, personally, I would have voted for H.B. Warner in LOST HORIZON [1937]!).Unfortunately, the audio level on Warner's otherwise exemplary DVD is rather low; the supplements include three vintage shorts (described in more detail below), as well as the full 1-hour broadcast of a radio adaptation of the script (obviously compressed but also including some minor additions) - presented by Leslie Howard (who, at the end, even interviews William Dieterle!) and featuring Muni himself, accompanied by Josephine Hutchinson (stepping in for Gloria Holden, who had played Zola's wife in the film).",15,16,False

tt0029146,A Life Worth Living - Zola Entertains As Few Biographies Can,7.0,"In a lucrative and highly successful career that saw him play everyone from Spanish savior, Juarez to a cutthroat gangster in Scarface, character chameleon Paul Muni became French novelist Emile Zola in ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (1937). This is perhaps the most legitimate and faithful - certainly, the most serious and stirring - biographical film to emerge from a major Hollywood studio, and so quite unlike anything that had ever been seen on the screen until that time. Warner spared no expense in retelling Zola's early and lingering success as an author and tragic death in a house fire. Embarking in idyllic 1862's Paris with Zola's initial fame, the film delves compassionately into the morbid curiosity and infamous trial known as the Dreyfus Affair. Encouraged by confidant and contemporary, painter Paul Cezanne (Vladamir Sokoloff) to dispel his own comfortable success and, to stand up for truth and justice, Zola decides to take on the case of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus (Joseph Schildkraut), a war hero unjustly accused of disclosing military secrets and imprisoned on Devil's Island. There are so many powerful and haunting moments in this bio that it's hard to pinpoint exactly where its greatness derives. But it is perhaps best exemplified by the dynamic interactions between Zola and Cezanne. These lead into the beautifully realized and justly celebrated court room summation that, once seen, is not to be forgotten.""There are times when the most courageous thing is to be cowardly"" exclaims Zola...indeed. The quiet rectitude of ""The Life of Emile Zola"" is a distinct pleasure for classic cinema fans - neither embellished or flag waving, but just as emotionally satisfying and twice as likely to be championed well into the next century. The film's definite slant toward critiquing anti-Semitism is now a time capsule; foreshadowing the growing angst of nations and Nazi terror that was to engulf Europe and cast the world into its second great war. However, William Dieterle's direction is timeless, with slick panache that makes all his points but never heavy-handed or without style befitting a classic biography. The score, by luminary composer Max Steiner, is striking and poignant. In short, ""The Life of Emile Zola"" is befitting of the Oscar for Best Picture and very much a relic from Hollywood's golden age worthy of considerable and repeated re-examination. Warner Home Video's DVD is a reason to stand up and cheer. While there are age related artifacts present throughout, and some scenes suffer from considerable grain, the overall image quality is solid, sharp and beautifully contrasted. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with deep, rich blacks and, for the most part, solid clean whites. Certain brief sections appear to have been duped in from second or third generation elements, but, keeping in mind that the film is 70 plus year old, such lapses should easily be forgiven. The audio is mono but has been presented at an adequate listening level. A slight hiss is detected occasionally. Save a complete and costly digital restoration, no more could have been expected by the good people at Warners on this transfer. It is head and shoulders above anything the film has looked like in years. Extras include a rare audio only recording of Muni doing Zola on radio, a dramatic, and, a cartoon short subject. The one disappointment here is that no time was taken to do a featurette on the making of this classic film. Regardless, it comes highly recommended by this reviewer.",11,13,True

However, it exhibits the strange quality of pictures from the thirties and forties in that is almost completely ignores the issue of anti-semitism.At the heart of the Drefuss affair was anti-semitism. The only reference to Dreyfuss's Jesishness is a brief moment when we see the notation that his religion is Jewish.I have lately noticed in films from this era that Jews were an oddly invisible group. Movies about World War II spoke about refugees, but seemed have overlooked the fact that Jews were the particular target of the Third Reich. Obviously this was a conscious decision on the part of the movie makers. Perhaps they felt that the country was not ready to face the fact of anti-semitism.It is in this context that I have come to realize the importance of ""Gentleman's Agreement"".",2,12,False
tt0029146,Very worthwhile,,"This film was presented last night on TCM and I found it to be extremely interesting and Paul Muni, HYPNOTIC. Of course we Americans are disenchanted by France's refusal to help us in Iraq as well as their scurrilous acts in sabotaging our efforts and I suppose this film adds fuel to MY fire. We see their late 1800s military echelon as corrupt, despicable, conniving and anti-Semitic. I was mortified by their framing Dreyfus based on convenience as well as a document, his profile which had on it...RELIGION-JEW. But let's keep in mind that unlike Denmark and Bulgaria during World War II, France did NOTHING but to allow the Nazi controlled Vichy Government to rule, to demand the turning over of French Jews for deportation and death in the extermination camps and indeed thousands of French Jews did perish.And so I automatically equated the treatment of Dreyfus to the incidents during W.W.II. This film won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture of 1937 and I feel politics could have played a most important part in it.We were just two years away from the German invasion of Poland signalling the beginning of the war. From Hitler's coming to power on 1/30/33 throughout 1937, the persecution of Jews in Germany was growing while anti-Semitism was on the rise throughout much of Europe therefore this film's making and release might not have been just something on the agenda for Warner Brothers. I feel it created and rightly so,sympathy for the plight of the European Jews by bringing to light the bigoted Dreyfus affair. Just one more notch in the belt of ""bigoted gunslingers"" so to speak. The cast of the film was outstanding especially Mr. Muni's role of a great French writer who was at first reluctant to become involved in the Dreyfus affair but then, at the expense of the greatest French honors to be awarded him,decided that human dignity and fairness took precedence over an award which propelled him into clearing Dreyfus's name and to have him released from inhuman Devil's Island confinement.We can all learn a thing or two from watching this film.",4,12,False
tt0029146,This is the most un WB-like 1930s Warner Brothers film I've ever seen..,7.0,"... and I've seen a lot of them, in particular the precodes.Warner Brothers did make heavy use of Paul Muni in the 1930s, particularly in their prestige pictures, capitalizing on his ability to completely physically transform into a role, and he uses that talent here, where he plays Emil Zola. The odd casting includes two actors well known as portraying villains - Joseph Schildkraut and Gale Sondergaard - as Captain Alfred Dreyfus, the wrongly accused and convicted member of the French army and his faithful wife, trying to find somebody who will help him, even after he is shipped out to Devil's Island. They are the only two completely likeable characters in the film, with the images of other treacherous characters they had portrayed somehow erased by their performances.Even Zola is not likeable through the entirety of the film. He starts out likeable, shown in his youth, looking for, finding, and writing about topics on injustice, but then he grows complacent as he ages, to the point that when Mrs. Dreyfus comes to him for help when he is late in life at first he resists her plea. But her case is compelling and he quickly changes his mind.The other thing I noticed in this film - It sure is good to be an American and have protections for free speech. Throughout his career Zola comes up against state censors who try to suppress his writings if they make France look bad. Then whenZola takes up Dreyfus' case he is prosecuted for ""criminal libel"" which is basically a law against making France look bad, with even the judge in the matter seeming to be in cahoots. No wonder the officers involved felt free to keep Dreyfus imprisoned even after they found out who the actual spy was.I'd recommend this film as a worthwhile watch, but I'm not sure it was the best film of 1937. I'd probably give that honor to The Awful Truth.",10,10,False
tt0029146,Outstanding Hollywood docudrama.,10.0,"This is a great movie. Although a work of fiction it is based on actual historical personages and events and has an authenticity which makes it even more compelling a drama. The movie deals forthrightly with the issues relating to the Dreyfus Affair, and shows how the military leaders of the French Army were willing to wrongly accuse and convict the wrong person purely for political reasons. Really disgraceful episode in French history. It also shows how Emile Zola bought into the Army's over story about Dreyfus and of his own initial resistance to take up the Dreyfus case. However, Zola emerges as a hero who comes to the defense of a man wrongly accused and terribly mistreated. Paul Muni gives an outstanding performance as Zola. In fact, his appearance id almost identical to that of the actual Emile Zola, which made his performance even more credible. The other members of the cast give powerful performances too, most noteworthy that of Joseph Schildkraut who plays Captain Dreyfus and his wife, played by Gale Sondergaard. If you want to learn about the Dreyfus Affair and at the same time be entertained this is the movie for you.",9,10,False
tt0029146,A Muni-ficent Performance!,10.0,"I don't know enough of the details of Zola's life, and the Dreyfus case, to make historical observations. But simply as a film, ZOLA is a superb example of how Hollywood can occasionally reach a height of inspiration. The script is extremely literate, the plot is compelling, and the performers are top-notch, especially Muni, who was robbed by the Academy. His handling of the character through several stages of life, and the wide range of emotions called for, was a praiseworthy effort.Some may say that the film loses focus when the Dreyfus affair takes over the plot thread from the narration of Zola's life as a writer. I see it rather as the summation of Zola's life. He has struggled from obscurity to wealth and fame by exposing the social ills of his time in his controversial novels and articles. But as Cezanne subtly points out, Zola has gotten rich and fat and that only leads to a dulling of talent. The Dreyfus affair is Zola's chance to prove that what he has written, he also truly believes himself. His defense of Dreyfus is the capstone of his work.This is one of the earliest films to tackle the sensitive topic of how much the government is willing to do to cover up its own faults. As such, it is valuable viewing for thinking people today. It's a shame that the studio wasn't bold enough to tackle what was really the central issue of the trial: Dreyfus's identity as a French Jew, and the rampant anti-Semitism of Parisian society, which continues today.When you watch ZOLA, keep in mind that to the 1937 audience, the Dreyfus trial was as recent an event as the assassination of Martin Luther King is to us today. It looks like an antique costume drama here in 2007, but in its day, it was still hot enough news that the studio had to leave some names out of the story.",7,10,False
tt0029146,"Slow Set-up, but Good Courtroom Drama",6.0,"Students of history, take note: Movies about real people and real events are not without their inaccuracies. There, now that I have that out of the way, let's talk about ""The Life of Émile Zola"".This movie tries to portray Zola as a struggling writer, an artist who creates only for art's sake. His mission is to expose the corruption of the French government with his writings. To a point, Paul Muni's portrayal of Zola is somewhat believable, but something intangible was missing from his performance.The first half-hour of the movie covers the early days of his career, as a man desperately trying to bring corruption and hypocrisy to the surface, so that all of Paris (and eventually the world) would remove its rose-colored glasses and do something to right the wrongs. But once his first book, ""Nana"", flies off the bookstore shelves, Zola begins his transformation into the kind of person he had been fighting all along: A rich fat-cat who would much rather collect fine artifacts and eat lobster at least once a week. Even his roommate from the early days, Paul Cezanne (Vladimir Sokoloff) finds he is forced to end their friendship because Zola can't return to those starving days of youth, while Cezanne himself had never left them. Though hurt by this news, Zola is still content with his life, until the Dreyfus Affair literally lands on his doorstep.The Dreyfus Affair takes up virtually the entire remainder of the movie, culminating in a courtroom drama I have yet to make a comparison with any other film. What makes the Zola trial unique in its presentation is that the defense was limited to a mere six lines of text related to Zola's ""J'Accuse..."" article, and that any mention of the Dreyfus case (which was officially closed) was not allowed. Zola is an underdog here and, though he'd been an underdog much of his life, this time he chose to take on the struggle.The performances in this movie are mixed. The standout performance, to me, belongs to Gale Sondergaard, as Dreyfus' tormented wife, Lucie. Joseph Schildkraut, who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Captain Dreyfus, did little more than scream ""I'm innocent!"" over and over (but he did do it well).""The Life of Émile Zola"" also has its comedic elements (seeing Zola struggle with not one, but two, umbrellas comes to mind), but they are few and far in between. I would suggest this film for people who like court dramas, especially the way this one was played out.By the way, in retrospect, I believe this was a daring movie for its time. After all, it centers around the persecution of a Jewish officer in a military rampant with anti-Semitism. More, this movie was released in 1937, during the beginnings of the American pacifist movement and the peak of Adolph Hitler's power in Germany. I should note that though no one mentions the word ""Jew"" in the movie, we know that Dreyfus was Jewish because it was listed in his biographical information in the military roster used to ""find"" the spy.Oh, and that ""inaccuracies"" thing I mentioned earlier? In the movie, Zola dies the night before Dreyfus is reinstated into the French Army. In truth, Zola died in 1902, and Dreyfus was pardoned in 1906. I do not profess to know much about the Dreyfus Affair, but I do know that much.",6,10,True

tt1517451,This was a good movie but not a great movie,7.0,"This was a good movie but not a great movie (this will not be a popular opinion). First the good stuff: Lady Gaga was perfect for and in this role - acting singing, chemistry, song writing - all fantastic. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Gaga was believable and, at times, breathtaking. The first two thirds of the movie had a great arch and captured us (as a friend, who watched the movie with me, said, ""I could watch the first part of this movie on repeat."") I am also a big fan of about 5 of the songs, and would add them to my library without hesitation, they are beautifully written. Now, the not so good stuff: the last third of the movie was too long - it could easily be cut by 20 minutes, but Bradley Cooper, as director, was more than a little self indulgent with his own scenes (we got the struggle, drawing it out didn't serve the storytelling). Ally's character arch was disappointing. As her star rose she didn't learn to love what Jack saw in her. She didn't learn to take ownership of her own story, the very gift Jack was trying to give her. Ally's story wasn't resolved until the very last moments of the movie, it was eclipsed by Bradley's directorial obsession with Jack's decline, belying the original premise of all the STAR IS BORN movies and lessening her triumph. I guess what moved it from great to good, for me, was that the first two thirds proved it could be great but the last third got hijacked (no pun intended). I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Music-centric Romantic Drama}",1148,1570,True
tt1517451,Is it a good film? Yes. Oscar material? No.,6.0,"Let me start by saying that the performances are solid. Not mind blowing but solid. For her first film, Lady Gaga did very well but I can't say she blew my mind...but hey it's her first film and I like her, so good for her. That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Cooper's character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didn't see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Cooper's performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gaga's character ascend to fame but again, we also don't see enough struggle from her character either. In all, the character conflicts are addressed but the film never fully dives into them in the way it certainly could have. I loved the first song of the film but the rest of the music was surprisingly bland and didn't captivate me at all. Lady Gaga obviously has an incredible voice and Cooper held his own surprisingly. Overall it was a good film, not great, just good.",1069,1532,False
tt1517451,A Star is BORED,4.0,"I am more than just a bit surprised how many of the IMDB reviews just glow about this remake, of another remake, of another remake of yet still another remake. In case some people don't realize it, this film has been over cooked since the 1930's.Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliott's gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity (Cooper) even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star. While Jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests in front of the door resting alone and waiting for his master Jack to come out from behind the closed garage door. Awwwwww shucks. Cooper's screenplay denotes ""sappy sucker tears called for here"".I wish Hollywood would welcome some fresh new screenwriters blood with some really creative ideas for screenplays rather than just use bonafide stars to re-write old screenplays and re-hash old movies and expect us avid filmgoers who enjoy going to actual movie theaters to suck the old crap up again and again.I bet that more than half the people who wrote a praiseworthy IMDB review in 2018 for this film won't even remember who starred in this 5th version of A Star Is Born because it is simply not a memorable film, nor is it worthy of the bloated high praise it has been garnering.

tt1517451,A Star is Born Shines (TIFF 2018),9.0,"If you're even a casual moviegoer, chances are you have already heard the argument; that originality is dead in Hollywood. We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldn't be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly don't capture the audience's hearts. They certainly don't capture the praise critics. They certainly don't take home any major awards.That all changes with A Star is Born.Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. (Or remakes of remakes of remakes...) In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. It's a delicate balance. Every version of a Star is Born follows a broken celebrity, in the Winter of his career, damaged by years of drinking who is suddenly reborn when meeting a young ingénue. The two fall in love, but while their relationship develops, their entertainment careers go in different directions.Director and Co-Star Bradley Cooper's film seemingly borrows more from the Streisand/Kristofferson iteration of A Star is Born (the last time this story was retold), as the dynamic between the two lovers hinges on the music industry. When Streisand and Kristofferson remade the film, (for the fourth time at that point) in 1976, they broke one of the aforementioned expectations, as they both took home Golden Globes for their performances. Perhaps Cooper was more inspired by performance, rather than aesthetic, as the acting is one aspect out of many that shines in Cooper's version. The characters of Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) drive the entire story in what is essentially a film with only half a dozen notable characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have amazing chemistry, and from the moment you see the two on screen together for the first time you feel the connection.First time director, Cooper, deftly creates intimacy between Jackson and Ally, without which the story would certainly not be as successful. In stadiums housing thousands of fans, in small dressing rooms packed with screaming Drag Queens, in a loud dive bar, in the parking lot of an all-night-grocer, Cooper uses tight framing and sound impeccably to make it seem like they're the only two people in the world. You understand his charm, you see her vulnerability, and the two actors give side-by-side stellar performances.That isn't to take away anything from a small, but powerful supporting cast. There were some brilliant and surprising moments from Dave Chappelle as Noodles, an old friend of Jackson's who reiterates how much Ally has revitalized Jackson. The largest surprise came from Andrew Dice Clay as Lorenzo, Ally's father. Both Clay and Chappelle brought great moments of love and humanity in their criminally small interactions with the two main characters. Sam Elliot also surprised me in his role as Bobby, Jackson's (much) older brother. They explain the age discrepancy, but the rest is self-explanatory as he and Cooper truly are brothers on screen, with all the frustration, fights and familiarity that goes with that relationship. Elliot in his similarly small time on screen, often showed the softer side of his craft, hiding touching instants of sadness when it comes to his difficult relationship with his brother, concealed only slightly by his iconic mustache.It begs the question, does Cooper deserve all the praise as director, or does the cast? What I can glean from the film is Cooper definitely had his cast on the same page, as regardless of screen time, these actors made you care about their characters. The audience is invested. There are countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating or angering. Instead of merely recognizing that these are hurdles to push the story further, I found myself almost vocally upset, akin to yelling at a character in a horror film to not go in the room where the killer is hiding. This film makes you want the protagonists to succeed, even when dealing with topical subplots regarding celebrity, regret, depression and substance abuse.And that's because you're along for the ride the entire time. You're a part of this love story. The film sucks you in from the beginning with the roar of a raucous concert audience, the hard beat of the drums on Jackson's stage, and his hypnotic swagger as he plays for thousands. If you were one of the millions of people who have seen the trailer for this film, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about (kudos to the promotional department of this film, as that, is an extremely engaging and powerful trailer) but it stems from an extremely engaging and powerful film. The music, much like it did with the trailer gets inside you, not just inside your head where you find yourself humming a gentle country lilt sang by Cooper, it gets inside your heart and soul and rattles around. It repeats over and over until you're the one who doesn't want to let go. While Cooper should be commended for taking his craft seriously and improving his singing, this is where Lady Gaga shines, to no one's surprise.Ally is a perfect role for her. The performer has spoken about how vulnerable and ugly she felt in some scenes when shooting this film, but it made her so real on screen. Ally's career, much like the first half of the film, blasts off, and all you can do is hold on until you realize the songstress is belting a powerful ballad. You wonder, much like her character ""how did we get here"" but at that point, you're just happy to be along for the ride. It is a testament to Lady Gaga's ability, because being such an iconic figure, if it weren't for her conveyance of sincerity and humility, the character's journey would seem forced and unfulfilling. Because of Gaga's performance, however, you relish the moment Ally can finally embrace who she is and bravely belt out her songs with no inhibition. In a film with so many moments that grab you, the music is undeniably one of my favorite aspects. I can't wait for this film to get a wider release so the studio can also make the soundtrack available.If and when Award season comes, and A Star is Born is undeniably a forerunner for several major awards, I think Cooper should be commended simply because as director, he brought everything together. The songwriters, the actors, the cinematography, the sound design was superbly balanced to create the best possible version of this story making it, the brightest star for both critics and audiences.",464,696,False

Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper.

tt1517451,Dullsville Arizona.,4.0,"This story has been filmed three times before: in 1937 (with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March); 1954 (with Judy Garland and James Mason) and 1976 (with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson). In all of these films the story has been the same: an alcoholic and over-the-hill actor (or with Kris Kristofferson, rock star) finds a young talented ingenue to love and develop into a superstar.The modern day remake is a little different in that Jackson Maine, our older star (now played by Bradley Cooper), is a stadium-filling mega-rock-star, recognised and idolised in every bar he goes into.... and he frequents a LOT of bars. Maine mixes the cocktail with drugs in this version meaning that as one star is ascending, his seems destined to be heading into a black hole.At its heart, this is a good story of having self-confidence in your own abilities, no matter how people around you try to put you down. Gaga's Ally is one such person; a waitress who is constantly being told, especially by her blue-collar dad and his boozy friends, that although she has a great voice she's ""never going to make it"" because of the way she looks. In chilled fashion she meets Jackson Maine, who hears her sing and thinks she might be on the edge of glory. Not worried about her big nose, he appreciates she was born that way: in fact he likes her so much he wants to poke her face. (Sorry... couldn't resist it).I appreciate from the IMDB rating that I am probably in a minority here. (At the time of writing this is (imho) a ridiculously high 8.3). But for me, I found the whole thing a dull affair. I can't remember the last time I went to a film when I actively looked at my watch... but 1 hour 45 into this, I did (it had another 30 minutes to run).For one thing, I just didn't believe Bradley Cooper as the rock star character. He just came across as totally false and unbelievable to me. I had more resonance with Gaga's Ally. Even though she is a novice actor (and it showed at times) in general I thought she did a creditable job. But given these two factors together, there are long and indulgent exchanges between the pair that seemed to me to go on in-ter-min-ably. Best actor in the film for me was Sam Elliott as Jackson's brother Bobby. The mellowing of the brothers is a scene that I found genuinely touching.I'd also like a glance at the original script, since there are some passages (the ""boyfriend/husband"" lines is a case in point) where it felt like one of them made an script mistake and, instead of Cooper (as director) shouting ""cut"", they kept it going as some sort of half-arsed improv.What is impressive is that they got to film at live concerts (including at Glastonbury), although most of this footage is of the hand-held nausea-inducing variety. There is zero doubt that Gaga can belt out a song better than anyone. But I didn't get that same feeling about Bradley Cooper's singing: like a lot of this film (with Cooper as co-producer, co-screenwriter AND director) it felt to me like a self-indulgent piece of casting.I know music is extremely subjective, and ""country"" isnt really my think anyway. But the songs by Gaga and Lukas Nelson were - ""Shallow"" aside - for me rather forgetable.Overall, in a couple of years that have brought us some great musicals - ""La La Land""; ""Sing Street""; ""The Greatest Showman"" - here's a film about the music industry that did nothing for me I'm afraid.",253,473,False

tt1517451,"Starts in exhilarating fashion, although loses steam",7.0,"It's a story as old as time, and that's evident in the fact that Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born is the fourth (yes, FOURTH) remake of the movie classic. However, with clearly passionate directing and acting throughout, furthered by wonderful music and an efficient portrayal of the classic rags-to-riches story, this proves a thoroughly entertaining and memorable watch that absolutely flies by over the course of nearly two and a half hours.But before we get into all that, I have to start with the film's opening half hour, which is exceptional. Despite its long running time, there's so much packed into the opening act, and it's delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-old story about finding fame in beautiful and riveting fashion.In fact, in the knowledge that it's a story that you know like the back of your hand, Cooper ingeniously ramps the dial up to eleven as we watch our young up-and-coming star caught up in an exhilarating whirlwind as she is suddenly transported from a small waitressing job to singing in front of thousands, culminating in a stunningly moving musical sequence that feels like a true epiphany, as you watch this young woman overwhelmed as she gets her first taste of stardom, something that I was absolutely blown away by.That opening half hour is truly exceptional. Full of emotion, drama and moving at a pace that mirrors the dramatic transformation from ordinary singer to superstar, it's exhilarating to watch at every moment, and easily the best opening act I've seen from a film this year, setting up the rest of the film fantastically.Rather unfortunately, however, things don't quite pan out in the same stunning fashion through the rest of the movie. While the remained of A Star Is Born is still good, I was left feeling a little disappointed that it couldn't keep up that same exhilarating energy and emotion from the first act, as things quieten down and become a little more predictable.Of course, there's nobody who doesn't know this story, so being predictable isn't as much of a problem, but what I found frustrating about the film was how it failed to keep delving deeper into the lives of the lead characters as their careers start flying in completely opposing directions.As a director, Cooper did an incredible job with the opening half hour, and his passion for the subject matter remains strong throughout, but the problem comes in the way that he portrays the main points of this age-old story in a rather plain fashion, moving a little too readily onto each new stage in the two singers' careers without leaving enough time for things to settle.In that, the film has a good pace to it that makes it a thoroughly entertaining watch right to the end, but with the exception of the opening act and the finale, there just isn't enough depth to the individuals here, leaving me a little detached from their emotions throughout the middle portion, and having to rely on my knowledge of the classic rags-to-riches story to understand more about what they were feeling.So, a little bit more clarity and patience would have gone a long way here, and I would have been genuinely happy to watch another half hour or so of the film.While the second two-thirds of the movie aren't so profoundly moving, that doesn't mean there's nothing to praise, because along with Cooper's passionate directing, we see two fantastic performances from the director himself as well as Lady Gaga.Starting off with Bradley Cooper, his portrayal of an aging and fading star is thoroughly fascinating to watch. While he doesn't appear as the story's main focus, the quality of his performance is such that I was at times even more invested in his character than the rise of the starlet, as he pulls off the maturity and likability of his battle-hardened character while still putting in a powerful portrayal of his deeper weaknesses, something that makes him both delightfully appealing and still deeply interesting to follow throughout.Alongside Cooper is Gaga, who is a real revelation here. Given that she's never been in a role of this magnitude before, her acting ability is truly stunning, and she gives a performance that's just as profound and striking as any experienced A-list actress. Taking from her own experience of life in the music business and her rise to stardom in real life, the passion that she feels for her character is clear in every scene, with that previously mentioned epiphany-inducing musical number 'Shallow' featuring the best example of her incredible acting.She holds fantastic chemistry with Cooper, and the two make their characters' relationship both convincing and genuinely appealing, even through the inevitable ups and downs of the story, keeping your interest strong as the film moves through the story towards the finish.In the end, I was very impressed with A Star Is Born. It's unfortunately not pitch-perfect all the way through, but after a mind-blowing opening act, and featuring passionate and likable directing and performances throughout, it proves a massively entertaining watch regardless, with some excellent music to boot.",270,421,False

I found the F word so often said that it took away from the film. I say that word from time to time but not 74 times in two hours. And, I'm 33 years old. And, I'm not bashful. Lada Gaga is the reason for the crowded theater. If they said Stephanie Germanotta was the actor in it, the theater would have been empty. I personally like her and admire her for opening up about her mental and physical struggles. That is a great help for so many! But, this is a movie and not a lipped sync'd video. The Lady Gaga marketing didn't make up the difference for this film.One poster asked a good question: How many 10 out of 10's can fans give a movie when it isn't even released?

I just saw it again on DVD, and it's as much fun as I remember it. In 108 minutes, I wouldn't be surprised if 90 minutes was music, and what music! One Irving Berlin song after another, sung by either Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, or Jack Haley. A young Merman, with a sexy figure, really pops in this film with her exciting belt voice.A thinnish plot surrounds the songs. It's the story of a classical musician (Tyrone Power) who forms a swing band and, because of the song ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" takes the name Alexander for himself and the Ragtime Band for his group. The movie takes us loving, losing, and playing music through World War I and into the swing era, though there's not a gray hair to be found among our heroes.Ameche and Power were friends before either one of them was signed by 20th Century Fox, and with Faye, they made ""In Old Chicago"" together plus this film - and both Faye/Ameche and Faye/Power made other films together as well. The three work very well as an ensemble. Faye is especially lovely in this. She sings in a commanding contralto, wears some great fashions, and is appropriately feisty, low-class, or classy as the part demands.As lovely as she was, though, she's no competition for the most gorgeous one in the movie, Tyrone Power. He's pretty darn breathtaking in that tuxedo of his. He could have conducted me anywhere.Monumentally entertaining music and plenty of eye candy - highly recommended.",14,21,False
tt0029852,An All-Time Classic,,"""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" has always been a personal favorite of mine and an excellent example of the kind of lively and jubilant musicals Fox specialized during the golden age. It was a huge hit in its day and remains a huge improvement over the monotonous ""In Old Chicago""(1937). I saw ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" again last night and it may well be my favorite Fox musical, though I have dozens of other favorites. Directed by the underrated Henry King with a rich and endlessly tuneful score, the film is a fictionalized account on the early days of jazz, and contains close to 30 Irving Berlin songs. Alice Faye never looked so ineffably beautiful, Tyrone Power never more charismatic, Don Ameche never more genial. It's all about the music and the stars. A great timeless classic that becomes more entrancing and enriching with each viewing.",18,21,False
tt0029852,The First Irving Berlin Songfest,8.0,"I wouldn't want to put money on it, but I'm willing to say there must be at least 25 Irving Berlin songs in Alexander's Ragtime Band. This was the first of those Irving Berlin extravaganzas where a history of an era was told with his music, the others being Blue Skies and There's No Business Like Show Business. After what happened to his score in Reaching for the Moon, Berlin demanded and got complete control in every film that he wrote or supplied the music for. And you will not hear one note of any other composer's music. Just listen to the background music and you'll see what I'm talking about.The song Alexander's Ragtime Band is considered Berlin's first big popular hit and so a story was constructed around a group of itinerant musicians who when they hire girl singer Alice Faye make a huge hit with the selfsame Alexander's Ragtime Band. So the film is about the lives and loves of Faye, Tyrone Power, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley, etc. for an over quarter of a century. Except for Power, all these other folks are real talented musically and they contribute vocally with a lot of Irving Berlin old favorites. And Alice Faye and Don Ameche both sang a new tune Berlin wrote for this film, Now It Can Be Told. Faye's version is especially grand, one of her best movie songs.Tyrone Power one of the finest of leading men in old Hollywood was unfortunately not blessed with a singing voice. Just hear him on a few bars of another Irving Berlin song in Second Fiddle and you'll see what I mean. He leads the band and it looks a bit ridiculous for him to be doing that and watching the others perform.This film is the reason I've been long convinced that Darryl F. Zanuck hired John Payne, an actor who looked somewhat like Power and could contribute musically in films with Faye, Betty Grable and the rest of Fox female musical ladies.Of course anyone who really loves Irving Berlin's music will watch this film and won't quibble about Tyrone Power not singing.",15,17,False

tt0029852,DVD COMMENTARY A FEAST OF KNOWLEDGE!,8.0,"20th Century Fox's 1938 Alexander'S RAGTIME BAND, Number 22 in their ""Studio Classics"" series, is with the exception of there 1927 SUNRISE (which was offered only as a promotional item), the earliest title to be offered and it turns out to be quite delightful!Like many musicals of the time the story is slight and mainly used to advance the musical portions, but this one boasts a large collection from the pen of one of the best -- IRVING BERLIN!Fox had wanted to do a biography on Irving Berlin -- instead Berlin worked out the story idea of a fictional bandleader ushering in a whole new era of swing music. Berlin worked with Fox during the two year period that was needed to prepare this lavish musical -- and the results are very entertaining as it presents 28 of his most famous songs. Alfred Newman's handling of the music won him a well deserved Oscar.The cast, which includes Tyrone Power, the delightful Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Jack Haley (the Tin Woodman in ""The Wizard of Oz"") and a young and very attractive looking Ethel Merman, soars under the hand of veteran director, Henry King. There really isn't a ""false note"" in acting department.Over all the picture rendered on the DVD is quite beautiful (though there are a few side scratches from time to time). The icing on this DVD is found in some marvelous ""Extras"": First of all there is a very fine A&E Biography, ""Alice Faye: The Star Next Door"", that gives a wonderful account of this once very popular star. There are dozens of nice clips from her film work at Fox (that make you wish that Fox would put out an Alice Faye Collection of six or so of her films in a package like Universal did with Deanna Durbin). After watching this biography I felt like Miss Faye must have been a very nice person as well as a talented singer and actress.The big surprise is found in the Commentary Track provided by Film Score Restorationist RAY FIOLA. I had the opportunity to meet this gentleman at a Film Score presentation at Brigham Young University. BYU holds the Max Steiner Collection, which includes a large number of phonograph recordings of sound track music that were used for playback as the scores as they were recorded on the sound stages. BYU has issued a series of sound track CD's made from their holdings. Fiola is one of the world experts on preparing these 78rpm records for transferring to CD's. His commentary on this DVD provides a wealth of information about Berlin, his songs and the actors and other behind-the-scenes people who brought ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND to life. He's more informative then a university film class -- and very interesting. This is one of the best of the Fox commentary tracks. Fiola even gives you information on ordering a CD of the ALEXANDER tracks that he worked on.There is even more: How about three deleted scenes -- which means three deleted songs (and they are all very nice to see and hear). Also included are shots of Irving Berlin being interviewed at the London premiere of the film in newsreel footage.All in all, this is a very nice addition to the Fox ""Studio Classics"" series -- one that is well worth adding to anyones collection who is interested in the history of the movies -- especially the history of film musicals.",13,15,False
tt0029852,"Despite the polish, it's pretty much what you'd expect and nothing more.",6.0,"This film starred the top talent at Twentieth-Century Fox. Tyrone Power (who could not sing or play music), Alice Faye and Don Ameche star in this film directed by Henry King and featuring the music of Irving Berlin. Clearly it was a prestige film for the studio--a large budget film with high expectations for success.The film begins with Power playing sophisticated music for a crowd of high-class folks. Only moments later, however, he's playing Ragtime music for a crowd in a bar--and it's obvious that he's torn between the world of society and popular music. Quite by Hollywood accident, the feisty Alice Faye is pulled into Power's band and the way she and Power meet and get along is very clichéd--you know, the misunderstanding that results in them becoming enemies and you KNOW they'll be in love sooner or later! She is a low-class dame and over time, Power is able to polish her image and make her a success--along with his band. On hand is another cliché--the nice-guy friend (Ameche) who loves the girl but demurs when his friend and the dame become a pair. You almost feel sorry for Ameche getting such a thankless role as the 'nice' friend...though I am sure his enormous checks from the studio more than made up for this! And then there's the final big cliché when Faye and Power break up--only, naturally, to be reunited by the film's conclusion. The only question is what, exactly, will happen in between--and there are certainly a lot of twists that occur in the interim in their parallel journeys. WWI, another woman (a younger and amazingly pretty Ethel Merman), marriage and bootlegging all are among the things the film explores during this portion. And if all this seems familiar, it is if you've seen many Fox musicals. This plot, with a few changes, was used in ""King of Burlesque"" and many other films with Alice Faye.As for the film overall, it's pretty much what you expect from the studio--a lot of music (way too much, actually), a lot of polish and the best sets money can buy (Twentieth-Century Fox and MGM were the kings of such lavish productions). But, beneath all the polish, it is all formula and clichés--the sort of film that is pleasant but certainly not a must-see. Plus, oddly, the music, for the most part, isn't exactly Ragtime--often it's more the typical sort of musical numbers you'd see in just about any Fox production of the day.By the way, in the WWI portion, I noticed that some of the soldiers were amazingly old and fat. Were we THAT desperate for men?! And get a load of those devil-girl dancers at about the 75 minute mark!",8,13,True
tt0029852,Down Melody Lane,9.0,"ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND (20th Century-Fox, 1938), directed by Henry King, reunites the lead performers of Tyrone Power, Alice Faye and Don Ameche from the blockbuster success of IN OLD CHICAGO (1937) in a musical cavalcade of Irving Berlin songs spanning two decades. One of the first in a long cycle of 20th/Fox musicals focusing on the ""as time goes by"" theme, keeping the story together through the mixture of old and new song standards. Fox would recycle such stories similar to this over the years, with imitations done by other studios as well, with ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND, the one that started it all, musically ranks one the best of its kind.The story begins in San Francisco's Barbary Coast, circa 1911, where young aristocratic Roger Grant (Tyrone Power) disappoints his strong-willed Aunt Sophie (Helen Westley) and Professor Heinrich (Jean Hersholt) by abandoning classical music for something on a more popular level. Forming a band consisting of Charlie Dwyer (Don Ameche), composer and pianist, and Davey Lane (Jack Haley), a drummer, they go to audition at a bar called Dirty Eddie's. Charlie misplaces their song sheet and at the last minute acquire one belonging to another. They play the new composition of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" but when Stella Kirby (Alice Faye), mixing with some friends, hears her borrowed music being played, she immediately heads towards the platform singing the lyrics. They become an immediate hit and Roger becomes Alexander and his Ragtime Band. In spite of Alexander and Stella constantly bickering and misunderstanding each other, it is Charlie who acts as their referee. As time passes on, Charlie, who now loves Stella, learns, while she sings one of his original compositions, that she really loves Alex. After Stella gets a job offer from Broadway producer Charles Dillingham (Joseph King), she accepts, forgetting about the band. In doing this, Alex and Stella part company, as does Charlie during a heated argument. Charlie marries Stella,and realizing she's still in love with Alex, decides to grant her a divorce for her sake. As for Alex, he prospers with Jerry Allen (Ethel Merman), as his new vocalist, while Stella leaves Dillingham and fades away to obscurity, causing Alex, now world renowned and performing at Carnegie Hall, to wonder whatever became of her. The motion picture soundtrack is as follows: ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" (sung by Alice Faye); ""Ragtime Violin"" (sung by Jane Jones, Otto Fries and Mel Kalish); ""International Rag"" (Alice Faye, Jack Haley and Chick Chandler); ""Everybody's Doing It"" (Alice Faye, Wally Vernon and Dixie Dunbar); ""Now It Can Be Told"" (Don Ameche); ""Now It Can Be Told"" (reprize/Alice Faye); ""This is the Life"" (Wally Vernon); ""When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'"" (Alice Faye); ""For Your Country and My Country"" (Don Douglas); ""In the Y.M.C.A."" (The Kings Men); ""Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning"" (Jack Haley/chorus); ""We're on Our Way to France"" (sung by soldiers); ""Say It With Music"" and ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"" and ""Blue Skies"" (all sung by Ethel Merman); ""Blue Skies"" (reprize, Alice Faye and Merman); ""Pack Up Your Sins and Go to the Devil"" (Ethel Merman); ""What'll I Do?"" (The Kings Men); ""My Walking Stick"" (Ethel Merman); ""Remember?"" (Alice Faye); ""Everybody Step"" (Ethel Merman); ""I'm All Alone"" (Alice Faye); ""Marie"" (instrumental); ""Easter Parade"" (sung by Don Ameche); ""Heat Wave"" (Ethel Merman, chorus); ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" (reprize, Alice Faye).With such an impressive cast headed by the up-and-coming Tyrone Power, who spends more time waving his stick, and in true Hollywood storytelling, arguing and making love with his female vocalist(s), it's easy to see its initial popularity, earning several Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, with the music keeping much the scenario together. A personal favorite of Alice Faye's, it not only allows her to sing one hit song after another, but to challenge herself as both vocalist and actress, whose character starts off as a tough gal sporting flashy clothes and plenty of facial make-up before changing through the passage of time to a more softer persona moderately dressed. While much of the principal players remaining physically the same throughout its 106 minutes of screen time, with the exception of costumes reflecting the changing of times, Don Ameche's only major change is sporting a mustache during the film's second half.At one point in television history, ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND did enjoy frequent revivals until the mid 1970s when some legal entanglement kept it off the TV markets for quite some time. Then in 1991, it was brought back to the airwaves, on commercial television, and notably on cable television's American Movie Classics in 1991-92 before distribution on video cassette in 1992, and later onto DVD, Fox Movie Channel and Turner Classic Movies where it premiered February 11, 2010. In 1997, AMC presented a the well documented special titled ""Hidden Hollywood: From the Vaults of 20th Century-Fox"" narrated by Joan Collins, presenting musical outtakes, several from ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND, including Ameche's singing ""Some Sunny Day,"" and Merman in fine voice as always singing ""Marching Along With Time,"" the tune that underscores the opening and closing credits. These outtakes are used as added attractions on DVD. Other victims of the editors ax might be those of Jean Hersholt and Helen Westley, whose characters are seen to the limit. Of the supporting players, many are too numerous to pen their individual attention, are Paul Hurst, best known for playing villains or gangster stooges, ideally cast in a sympathetic role as Bill Mulligan, and John Carradine, appearing briefly as a taxi driver and avid fan of Stella Kirby.With Power and Faye constantly settling the score with one another, ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND swings into action hitting many high notes, with much of its melody lingering on.

This was a treat that I do not recall seeing in any other movie. Their low and higher voices actually complemented each other. That they were each interested in the same man did not seem to really matter.In this movie, Ethel was not as recognizable as in later movies in which she would appear, full-figured, in such song-belting movies as ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and ""Call Me Madam"".

The skirts were too short, the jackets had shoulder pads and nipped in waists, and the women's hairstyles and hats were totally wrong for the 1920s. I kept wondering how many years had passed!

However, Tyrone Power is the only major actor who lacks musical talent, and it shows. Both Don Ameche and Jack Haley add luster. Alice Faye is adequate.The film is less constricted by plot than other musicals. But there's still a lot of dialogue. And, except for the title song and a quick version of ""Easter Parade"", the music is somewhat bland and uninteresting. I would have preferred more evocative music. The film's tone ranges from semi-bawdy to mushy romanticism.This is a large-scale, Americana period piece film, with an accent on the music of Irving Berlin.

tt0029852,"Come On and Hear, Come On and Hear My Review",7.0,"Roger Grant, a classically trained violinist, is leading a small band in turn of the century San Francisco with little success. One fateful night, Stella Kirby, brings sheet music of Irving Berlin's new song, Alexander's Ragtime Band. Stella sings while Roger plays the song, and all three are a hit, despite the friction between Roger (who now is the Alexander from the song) and Stella. Obviously there is hints of romance between the two, but fellow band member Charlie Dwyer completes the love triangle, and is the one who captures Stella's hand in marriage. Roger/Alexander and his band tour the country and entertain the troops overseas in World War I, and returns to the US a sensation, while the marriage between Stella and Charlie falls apart because the two realize they are not the ones meant for each other. Stella tries to rekindle the romance with Roger, but singer Jerry Allen has fallen for the band leader, despite being somewhat indifferent towards her. Roger, Charlie, and the rest of the band perform a concert reuniting everyone, while Stella feels on the outside thinking she has no part in Roger's life. The film's story line is predictable, full of holes, and mushy and the performances are enjoyable at best, but the film carries such an energy thanks to Berlin's music, as well as the singing from both Faye and Merman (who does stand out in this early role). The musical numbers are quite different from the ones preceding it, which does keep the movie fresh. Rating, 7.",2,3,True

From this moment on, he is known as Alexander! We then have the usual fall in love, out of love, hook up with someone else kind of story until everything is resolved at the end.The story isn't much to write home about and the relationships don't make sense but the music is good and John Carradine as a taxi driver single-handedly saves the film towards the end as it starts to get a little tedious. We know where things are headed but the cliché story begins to drag. Carradine is the best taxi driver ever - great attitude. I didn't realize so many tunes came from this film.

He looked clunky for the terpsichory, but was adequate. If people say Ethel Merman wasn't as good a belter as in later films, I feel that her later bodily heft gave her a way stronger chest and ribcage in order to produce her all-time famous singing extravanganzas. Witness her lead belting in There's No Business Like Show Business. She was also known for good diction and proper forming of the lips, jaw and mouth for excellent song projection - not to mention her legendary mile high pipes. Here, anyway, in this film, she is thinner and her voice would go on later to attain that famed foghorn loveliness. Creepy: 1936 film San Francisco (two years earlier) was made, about a SF Barbary Coast nightclub called The Paradise, owned by the Clark Gable character. The Paradise's featured singer was the Jeanette MacDonald character. Either Gable or the Spencer Tracy priest character removes MacDonald's trashy flowers from her costume; I can't remember which one. Anyway, this film early on reminded me of the Gable film when we saw the Barbary Coast dive with Alice Faye. In real life, Tyrone Power fought in World War Two in the Pacific, according to a late friend of mine who fought with him. This is ironic, being that this film shows Power's character going overseas in World War One.",0,2,True
tt0029852,"For Irving Berlin fanatics, 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' is a must watch",8.0,"The involvement of a talented cast (Tyrone Power, Don Ameche, Alice Faye, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley) and director (the undervalued Henry King) and with songs penned by one of the greatest song-writers of all time Irving Berlin were reasons enough to see 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' in the first place.And on the most part it did not disappoint. Its only primary fault really is the thin-on-the-ground (merely an excuse to string along songs together) and old-hat (with a concept that has been done to death and much better) story, that is even further advantaged by that it's pure sappy hokum, that it's rather perfunctorily paced at the beginning and that the First World War stuff is dispatched rather too quickly, almost like a throwaway.It is constantly mentioned that one shouldn't see musicals for their stories, but it always depends on how well done everything else is, if other elements are not very well executed or if the story is the only element not so well executed that it sticks out like a sore thumb it is more noticeable and does sort of matter. The latter is the case here.However, the main reason to see 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' is the music. It is literally an Irving Berlin song-fest and what a glorious one it is too, not hard at all to see why the musical is considered his first big popular hit. Some of the songs are among his most well-known and best, especially ""Blue Skies"", ""Easter Parade"" and ""Heat Wave"".The title song, ""This is the Life"", ""My Walking Stick"" and ""All Alone"" are similarly wonderful, but really there isn't a bad song in the bunch. They are very nicely staged too, with the most note-worthy being ""My Walking Stick"", a lot of fun, and the Faye and Merman rendition of ""Blue Skies"", which admittedly made me tear up.'Alexander's Ragtime Band' looks good too, being handsomely shot and with elegant costume design. The sets, while not lavish or expansive, are still very easy on the eye. The script crackles, amuses and affects, and despite the perfunctory beginning once the film picks up and it does so very quickly the energy is non-stop. King directs with panache and class.Power's gorgeously handsome looks, immense likability and magnetic charisma film are so winning here that I was willing to forgive his reasonably limited singing ability and lack of rhythm, things usually not really that forgivable personally when watching musicals. Faye sings beautifully, especially in ""Remember"" and ""All Alone"" that are also sung with heartfelt emotion, the camera clearly loves her and she is impossible to resist or dislike.Ameche completes the love triangle charmingly in the most effortless of ways, and is every bit as likable as Power. Merman steals scenes with her boundless energy and big brassy voice that soars in songs like ""My Walking Stick"", ""Everybody Step"" and particularly ""Pack Up Your Sins and Go to the Devil"" while also softening in ""Blue Skies"" and ""A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody"". Haley, in a pre-Tin Man role, dances with energetic athleticism and has a very appealing presence on film.In summary, with the sole exception of the story a winner all round, with the biggest joy being the songs. Essentially a must watch for Berlin fanatics, because they will be in heaven.Power, Ameche, Faye and King also worked together in 'In Old Chicago', and while it had a riveting final twenty minutes, with terrific visuals for back then and now, and the cast acquit themselves very well it is nowhere near as good a film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",2,2,False

tt0029852,Enormous fun,9.0,"This is an extremely fun musical romantic comedy-drama which features the songs of Irving Berlin and stars Don Ameche (one of my absolute favourite actors), Tyrone Power and Alice Faye, three of Fox's biggest stars of the day. The screenplay was co-written by Berlin himself and features some of his best songs such as ""Heat Wave"", ""Easter Parade"" and ""Blue Skies"" (my personal favourite of those featured). It has a great supporting cast including future Tin Man Jack Haley, Ethel Merman, Jean Hersholt and Ruth Terry (who is still alive) as well as brief appearances by future horror icons Lon Chaney, Jr. as a photographer and John Carradine as the most unintentionally creepy taxi driver in film history.The film tells the story of a privileged young man named Roger Grant (played by Power), who takes the stage name Alexander and eventually becomes a bigwig on the swing scene, and his relationship with the initially unsophisticated ""platinum loudmouth"" Stella Kirby (played by Faye). After months of fighting, they realise that they love each other and become a couple but break up when Stella chooses to go to Broadway without Alexander and his band. After going to and returning from World War I, Alexander realises that he has been unfair to her and wants to get back together, only to find that she is married to his best friend Charlie Dwyer (played by Ameche, who gives the best performance in the film). However, everything turns out perfectly fine in the end and there is a happy ending of a kind that only Classic Hollywood could deliver! The second half of the film is far stronger than the first but it's a great feel good film. They don't make them like this anymore, I'm afraid. It's the kind of film that my grandmother loved.",2,2,True
tt0029870,An absolute classic,8.0,"Michael Curtiz has made some great films, yet the only one that tends to be well received among film fans is his contender for the best movie ever made - obviously Casablanca (and Robin Hood, to a lesser extent). However, the man has a wealth of other influential classics under his belt that don't tend to get the recognition that they deserve, and Angels With Dirty Faces is one of those films. To sum the film up easily, one would say that it is a crime drama. However; like the best crime dramas, this one has multiple themes that elevate it from being merely a film about crime, to being a character study, a portrait of what it is that makes a hero and a condemnation of criminals on the whole. The story follows Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly; two young New York thugs, the former of which is caught by the police and sent to a reform school, where, ironically, he learns to be a criminal. The latter escapes punishment and goes on to become a priest. The story follows these two men as they meet up as adults and have an effect on the lives of the kids of their old neighbourhood.The focus of the film is always centred on the neighbourhood. This allows Curtiz to show us the effects that Rocky's criminal endeavours have on the kids of the neighbourhood more effectively. This sort of narrative would be employed in later films, such as the critically acclaimed 'City of God', and works well here too. The way the film shows how impressionable young kids can be influenced by adults works brilliantly, and Curtiz is able to continue this theme up until the powerful ending. James Cagney would later go on to achieve major fame in the incredible 'White Heat', but here he shows us what the quintessential New York gangster would be like. His performance, in short, is incredible and easily ranks among the best gangster roles of all time. The rest of the cast do well in their roles, with distinct New York accents helping to firmly place the audience in the city that the film is taking place in. Furthermore, the film is economic in the way it's plotted and it's also very exciting, and therefore guaranteed to delight it's audience.Angels With Dirty Faces is an absolute cinema classic and quite why it isn't more famous is anyone's guess. Although not quite as good as Casablanca, this is a major notch in Michael Curtiz's filmography and I wouldn't have any qualms with recommending this to film fans at all.",61,76,False
tt0029870,Golden-age film offers great gangster yarn and metaphysical struggle,10.0,"""Angels With Dirty Faces"" has been called the gangster movie of the New Deal. Previously, with such early-30s films as ""Little Caesar"" and ""Public Enemy,"" gangster films at their best were engrossing actioners with charismatic but undeniably evil central figures. ""Angels With Dirty Faces,"" released in 1938, presents a more nuanced view of what makes the modern bad man tick. Is it a bad heart? Or is society to blame?Cagney is undeniably great in the role that made him a legend. His practiced patter never wears thin, and his screen presence is electric throughout. (Especially at the end, and I don't mean that as a pun.) But the screenwriters never let us forget the good in the man. We see him come up against more ruthless elements of the underworld, people like Bogart (a real baddie here) who have no compunction about killing a man if it means avoiding payment of a heavy debt. We see him interact with a group of starry-eyed juveniles (The Dead End Kids) whose nickel-and-dime antics fill him with a poignant but heartily-amusing nostalgia. And we see him try to do right by his former partner in crime, now a priest played by Hugh O'Brien.But Cagney is trapped by the circumstances of his life. He can't walk away from a life of crime, which has made him what he is and gives him the only life satisfaction he knows. He's correctly on guard for double-crossers at every turn. When cornered, his cheery face becomes bug-eyed and menacing. We know he's bad, but we like him, and that puts us in the company of the audience-surrougate figure, Father Connolly.Director Curtiz was an auteur before his time, filling his canvas with images of downtrodden street life. This isn't for mere effect, but to show us why Rocky is what he is and how come he finds little hope for his redemption. There are souls to be saved in this picture, but for Father Connolly, they are Laurie and the boys. He must take on his childhood chum, the same kid who saved Connolly from the perils of the Mean Streets and allowed him to become what he was.It is a choice between God and friendship, and while Connolly has little doubt which way to go, the audience may not be with him all the way. The ending points up this spiritual conflict in some of the most harrowing terms ever brought to screen at that time. When you really think about what's going on behind Connolly's face in that final scene, it's a real tear-inducer.Was Rocky's last scene a put-up job? I guess it can be argued back and forth, but the real question of value is whether, if it was faked, was it enough to perform a miracle even the good Father Connolly wouldn't have quite believed in, the salvation of Rocky. The last image of the boys, desolately accepting the news of their hero's fall, is at once triumphant and bittersweet. Nothing comes easy in this world of ours.""Angels With Dirty Faces"" may strike a falsely optimistic note to some, but it is optimism well-earned by the honesty of vision expressed. Add to that clever dialogue, great pacing, and one of cinema's keystone performances by Cagney, and you have a real keeper here.P.S. It also features one of the finest Cagney impersonations ever, by William Tracey as the young Rocky. Funny stuff.",46,63,False

He just dominates the screen and gets you very involved with his character, especially at the end. Pat O'Brien plays his normal somewhat-liberal and likable priest role and Humphrey Bogart is convincing as the crooked lawyer. Bogart was the bad guy in most films until he became a big star a couple years after this film. The ""Dead End Kids"" are a pretty tough bunch. Seeing them play basketball is quite a sight - more like rugby. It must be one of the highlights of this entertaining film because I remember it so well....it was so different from any other basketball game I've ever seen!The shootout-and-chase scene near the end was well-done with some great film-noir photography and the ending of the movie is quite memorable.

The story was obviously sentimental Its saving virtues were the performances by the leads, clever and suave, energetic direction by Michael Curtiz, and a good music score by Max Steiner Bogart had little, and certainly nothing new, to do as he played Cagney's lawyer-turned-nightclub-owner who double-crosses him",21,45,False
tt0029870,Cagney's First Screen Award Performance,10.0,"The rise and fall of Rocky Sullivan, tough guy gangster but square fellow, was the subject of this excellent film by Warner Brothers in 1938. It has several things going for it that maintains it's high ratings among gangster films and Cagney movies.For one thing, Cagney's brilliant performance as Rocky won him his first major film award - the 1938 New York Film Critics Award for best actor. It is frequently forgotten that Cagney won this award four years before his Oscar winner in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", but in actuality the performance was the high point of the work he did (up to that time) as a gangster (his performances in ""White Heat"" and ""Love Me Or Leave Me"" were way in the future). It drives home how much of a struggle it was for Cagney to get out of the gangster mode, and why his George M. Cohan was such a striking change for his fans.Secondly it was the sequel (the first sequel) of the Bowery Boy feature films after their introduction in ""Dead End"". Oddly enough, in that film, Humphrey Bogart was the out and out gangster ""Baby Face"" Martin, who was the villain in the film. Baby Face enjoyed his following with the gang of boys in that film. Here, though, Bogart was playing a weaselly lawyer named Jim Frazier, who is cowardly - quite a different type from Baby Face, who is angry at the state of his world and how ugly it has become. But Baby Face, at least, had guts.The Bowery Boys are again a gang of street kids, who Father Jerry Connelly (Pat O'Brien) is trying to keep on the straight and narrow. Here, however, they worship Rocky, the local punk who did rise in the underworld and made a name for himself. But Rocky is Jerry's oldest friend, and he is also willing to help the priest with the boys.The story deals with how Bogart and his new boss, Mac Keefer (the unjustly forgotten George Bancroft) have gotten control of over 100,000 dollars (1930 style dollars - about twenty million in buying power today), that belongs to Cagney. Cagney wants it back, and when Bogart and Bancroft keep putting him off he uses strong arm methods to force them into line. Eventually things blow up, and Cagney ends up in a gun battle that leaves a dead cop. He is tried and found guilty for this murder, and goes to the death house. This leads to one of the most frightening moments in Cagney's film career - when we see his final moments when being taken to the electric chair to be strapped in. I guarantee once seen you will never forget it.There are one or two interesting points of a historical nature about Cagney's performance as Rocky. First, that massive gun battle that is shown (where he kills the cop and battles the police department from a building. It actually happened! In about 1931 there was an incident in Manhattan when a young hood, ""Two Gun"" Crowley, held off police after a homicide in a battle that lasted nearly an entire afternoon. Crowley (like Rocky) was defeated by tear gas. Like Rocky, he too died in the electric chair.It has been pointed out that Cagney based some of Rocky's mannerisms on a drug addict character he knew in his old Hell's Gate/Yorkville area when he was a kid. Cagney mentions this in his memoir CAGNEY. But there is a curious second source. In his youth, Jimmy Cagney came from a family that struggled but managed to have food on the table and clothes on their back. But some of his playmates were not so lucky. One was a fellow nicknamed ""Bootah"" (because of the oversize boots he was forced to wear) whose real name was Peter Heslin. Cagney always was friendly with Peter, but their lives drifted apart. On April 5, 1926, Heslin was engaged in an armed robbery when an off-duty police officer, Charles H. Reilly, tried to stop him and was shot and killed. But Heslin (who was also wounded in the encounter) was captured shortly afterward. He was tried and convicted, and finally executed on July 21, 1927. That same night, a star was born on Broadway where Jimmy Cagney made a name for himself as a singer and dancer in the show ""Broadway"". Cagney was aware of the tragedy playing out with his friend at Sing Sing that night. He mentions Bootah's execution in his memoirs. Newspaper accounts of Heslin's electrocution do not mention anything unusual, but one wonders if (when Cagney was doing the scene) he thought of his unfortunate friend and added a bit more power to those last moments of the film.",35,41,False
tt0029870,Post Production Code Gangster Classic!,8.0,"""Angels With Dirty Faces"" was James Cagney's first film for Warner Bros. following his two year contract dispute. During that time he appeared in two films for the poverty row studio Grand National. With a few concessions to The Production Code (introduced in 1934) it is nonetheless one of the great all time gangster films. The touch of legendary director Michael Curtiz is evident throughout.The story begins in the 1920s with two boyhood pals ""Rocky"" Sullivan (Frankie Burke) and Jerry Connelly (William Tracy) in the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood of New York. Rocky gets arrested by the police and is sent to the reformatory after a botched break in while Jerry escapes. While in prison, Rocky learns the evils of gangsterism from within and forges a life of crime and growing up to be James Cagney. Meanwhile Jerry has become a priest in the Pierson of Pat O'Brien.Rocky returns to the old neighborhood and becomes involved with a group of teenagers (The Dead End Kids) who are headed in the same direction as Rocky. Fr. Jerry prevails upon Rocky to help him straighten the boys out before its too late. Rocky also meets up with a girl from his childhood, Laury Ferguson (Ann Sheridan).Meanwhile we learn that Rocky has served three years in jail to protect his former partner and lawyer Jim Frazier (Humphrey Bogart). He has also entrusted Frazier with $100,000 from an earlier caper. Rocky goes to Frazier to demand his money and learns that Frazier is now involved with crime boss Mac Keefer (George Bancroft) and that they plan to cheat him out of his money. Hey, nobody double crosses Rocky.Cagney is typical Cagney, bold, brash and cocky as Rocky. O'Brien as the Irish priest was a role he was born to play. Sheridan looks lovely but has little to do. Bogart, who was still 3 years away from major stardom, does well as the yellow back stabbing lawyer. The Dead End Kids - Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Bernard Punsley) would move to a ""B"" series (without Hallop) after their Warner contract expired in 1939.

tt0029870,Say A Prayer For A Kid Who Couldn't Run As Fast,9.0,"Angels With Dirty Faces is a milestone film for the careers of both James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. Up to now they had been successfully teamed by Warner Brothers in a whole series of buddy films. In fact it is my contention that they popularized that particular genre. Here they are childhood friends, but as adults, adversaries due to the course in life they took.Cagney came off suspension from Warner Brothers and agreed to do this film as his comeback of sorts. At first glance it seems just like another gangster flick, just what Cagney had been trying to get away from. But by force of personality and a superior script, Cagney turned the role of Rocky Sullivan into a classic and got his first Academy Award nomination.As for O'Brien, this was his first clerical role. Usually O'Brien is the fast talking manager, press agent,etc. When playing a priest Pat O'Brien slows the pace of the dialog down to a crawl and it works. He greatly expanded his range here and there were many other classic clerical roles to come.Cagney's a notorious gangster who's just been let out of prison after a three year stretch, taking a fall for his crooked attorney, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was supposed to guard his $100,000.00 Cagney had squirreled away from illegal activities in the Twenties. Bogart's got a new partner now in George Bancroft and neither of them wants to cut Cagney in on anything.Let's just say that Cagney in the usual Cagney fashion makes both of them wish they'd played it on the square.Father O'Brien's concern is that notorious criminal Cagney is becoming a hero to some of the neighborhood kids in his parish. But he also can't forget that the two of them had been boyhood pals and that Cagney's first brush with the law was over a petty crime that O'Brien was equally guilty of. This is shown in a small prologue with three players portraying, Cagney, O'Brien, and neighborhood girl Ann Sheridan as kids.Young Frankie Burke is astounding in his portrayal of the young Cagney. He has him down perfectly, he becomes Cagney. Angels With Dirty Faces is worth watching for him alone.Those other juvenile actors with Warner Brothers at the time, The Dead End Kids, play the kids from the parish who come to idolize and idealize Cagney. O'Brien has one tough time trying to make them see that Cagney's life is not the way to go in life.Angels With Dirty Faces still has a powerful message for today and film aficionados should see it because of that and because it was a key turning point in the careers of James Cagney and Pat O'Brien.",29,34,False
tt0029870,A classic early crime drama,,"Throughout the 1930's, Warner Brothers delivered many quality crime and gangster dramas that usually featured the likes of the studio's distinguished contract star roster. This 1938 release is one of the prime examples. James Cagney and Pat O'Brien (who were frequently cast in films together and this is their best one together) portray boyhood buddies who reunite years later after Cagney is released from prison where he had served for many years for a petty crime that he committed while he was still a kid. Cagney has not learned his lesson that crime doesn't pay and so he returns to his old neighborhood to set up his criminal hideout. Meanwhile, his old friend, O'Brien has given up being a street hood and has since become a respected priest who naturally doesn't think highly of the life that his friend has chosen for himself. To make matters worse, six young boys (portrayed by the Dead End Kids) whom O'Brien is trying to lead down the right paths begin to idolize Cagney. Humphrey Bogart also appears in a pre big box office star part as a lawyer and screen veteran George Bancroft also costars as a dishonest crime boss. Michael Curtiz' direction and Max Steiner's musical score are also highlights. This film is one of the all time great ones of the 1930's and an excellent showcase for its legendary cast and crew.",23,33,False
tt0029870,WILL THE CIRCLE REMAIN UNBROKEN???,,"This film is included on my personal top 10 list.  The old-time ethnic slums (?) of New York City in the 20's and 30's are a picaresque window to another time.  One where gangsters were heroes (to some) and filled newspapers with their exploits.  Tales of crime and riches are like candy to the gangs of kids living in poverty, while seeking their own escape to something better. They could only learn from experience, what Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) already knew, there is no honor among thieves.  No honor, and no road back for Rocky.  But, sometimes, for someone else, fate gets a push.A very interesting, fast-paced story, I recommend this highly.  The transition from Rocky's childhood to his adult years is especially well done and cast.  In 'spirited' discussions with friends, we STILL don't agree on Rocky's thoughts and motivations at the end of the film.  WAS HE GIVEN AN 'OUT' ?  WAS HE HERO OR COWARD?  WAS IT WHAT HE WANTED?  WAS IT IMPOSED ON HIM?  WAS IT CALCULATED OR DID IT POUR OUT UNCONTROLLABLY?  Judge for yourself.  After a few viewings, it's not as simple as it appears......",21,30,False
tt0029870,Silly but fun 30s nonsense.,,"As typical of crime dramas of the 30s and 40s as they get. A lot of mugging and animated acting from Cagney & co. Dated, but still enjoyable, partly for its unintentionally amusing over-the-top acting. The plot gets occasionally silly, but the ending surpasses everything previous with its absurdity; O'Brien actually visits his old pal Cagney minutes before Cagney's execution to ask him for a favour! (Though I am sure he would have visited him anyway, but that's beside the point.) Cagney has minutes to live before he gets electrocuted and what does his brother the priest do? He asks Cagney for a favour! As if Cagney hasn't got enough on his mind as it is, what with his life coming to an end, that he should also be doing favours for other people. Minutes later, as the two walk slowly towards the chair, O'Brien asks him whether he changed his mind about the favour (Cagney didn't want to oblige at first) and Cagney say no; that scene is pure (unintentional) comedy. But Cagney does oblige at the end, and acts scared at execution time, just as the priest wanted; could it be that Cagney wasn't so noble after all and didn't change his mind, but instead acted like any sane person would when faced with the electric chair? Hmm. It seems throughout the movie that Cagney the crook was a far more loyal friend to O'Brien the priest than the other way around: a strange message to make. Cagney delivers his lines with his usual machine-gun-fire style. Bogey I like here better than in films where he played classical bad guys; his acting as a lawyer is more subtle, with none of the silliness that some other of his roles entailed. O'Brien only has one facial expression throughout the film: an angelic, puppy-dog, ultimate honest-person look, and with nothing but goodness and the best intentions. He is a caricature. Sheridan is cute but doesn't appear much. ""Whatdoyouhear, whatdoyousay...""",8,18,True
tt0029870,Cagney vs. The Dead End Kids!,7.0,"One of the greatest films of Cagney's film career, and the film that unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your gag reflexes) introduced us to the Dead End Kids! James Cagney is a career criminal, who, immediately after getting out of the clink, meets up with his former partner in crime (Pat O'Brien!), who of course is a priest now and loathes the life Cagney leads. Cagney is also preoccupied with a bunch of no-good kids who of course idolize him. Seeing this, O'Brien thinks Cagney should lead the kids to good. But Cagney is too busy getting even with his old business cronies (Humphrey Bogart!).This film is a lot fun, most especially watching Bogey and Cagney on the screen together. For those rather uninitiated with the career of Bogart (eg, just seen Casablanca and the Sam Spade movies), this film may come as a revelation to you, as he plays a cretinous heel here. And Cagney? Ahhh, what's not to like? He's flawless here, (well, except his curious gun usage). As for the Dead End Kids, I liked them here, rather interesting that Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall almost are in the background here, with their leadership of the group not yet realized.",11,16,False

After three years in prison, Rocky is released and charges his former partner, the lawyer James Frazier (Humphrey Bogart), his US$ 100,000.00 and his share in the society, and is betrayed. Meanwhile, he becomes the idol of the street kids in the neighborhood. Although following opposite paths in life, Rocky and Jerry are still friends. When Jerry decides to fight against the corruption, Rocky is put against the wall between his friendship with the priest, and his society in dirty businesses with his criminal partners.""Angels With Dirty Faces"" is a great film-noir, with magnificent performance of James Cagney, who was nominated to the Oscar to Best Actor in a Leading Role for his excellent performance. The story of a charismatic criminal is engaging, but I did not like the final redemption of his character, and indeed I found the ending very disappointing and corny.

And not even the fact that he created a character in the usual whole sense.

tt0029870,Classic Melodrama That's Not For Cynics,8.0,"If you ever take a film class about gangster films you'll soon learn that it's a genre "" Catholic "" in outlook in much the same way as the western is "" Protestant "" . Once you analysis the gangster genre you'll find that there's almost a formulaic lay out of themes of a fatherless outsider trying to become part of the American dream via illegal means . ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES is slightly different in that the characters are Amercan born and it's the street gang of juvenile delinquents who are in need of the father figure and the film rests on whether Father Jerry Connolly or Rocky Sullivan becomes that father figure I'm feeling slightly ashamed of myself for saying this but I liked this movie a lot , and the reasons I liked it is down to the reasons that I shouldn't . There's hardly a single scene that rings of any type of realism . Cagney was a Hollywood star but he was never an actor . There is something compelling about his performances however and he dominates every scene he is in . I can certainly understand why some people don't like his acting style but it's a style that suits the film perfectly that lacks any type of verisimilitude . None of it rings true but there's something that keeps you watching even though there's a voice inside your head saying "" What a load of melodramatic Hollywood tosh ""Your opinion of the film lies with what you thought about the golden age of Hollywood . This was a period of American film making where producers were under heavy censure via The Hays Code where any type of immorality must be seen to be punished on screen and this suits a film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES wonderfully . Rocky is a bad man but a hero to the teenage street gang , he must not be allowed to be a hero to criminal youth and so must face death as a coward . On paper this appears to be the cheesiest ending ever seen in a movie but as it plays out on screen it's one the most beautiful and memorable endings Hollywood has ever produced . Michael Curtiz directs this scene via suggestion and is all the better for it If you're a fan of Old Hollywood then you'll enjoy this . Even a self confessed cynic like myself found this movie compelling . You have to be slightly forgiving for some of the more melodramatic aspects but in some ways that's part of the movie's appeal",8,13,True
tt0029870,Cagney in great form ****,9.0,"(possible spoilers):James Cagney really struts his stuff in this one, and all his classic ""caricature"" type movements and traits are on vivid display here. I loved the interplay between Cagney and Humphrey Bogart (in a supporting role); also intriguing was the relationship between the now-grown Rocky Sullivan (that's Cagney's character) and the straight-laced Jerry (played by Pat O'Brien), who was the childhood friend of Rocky and partner in mischief who wound up spending his adulthood as a priest while his companion never was able to go completely straight.The Dead End Kids tended to get on my nerves at times, but I guess that's partly what they're supposed to do, as street punks who idolize the legendary Sullivan and want to follow in his infamous footsteps. Just want to mention that I thought the ending - with Cagney's change of demeanor in the electric chair and the resulting disappointment of the kids who worshipped him - was a great cinematic moment by director Michael Curtiz. People have debated whether or not Cagney is supposed to be genuinely afraid at the end or just putting on a show for the kids to learn something from. I'm of the opinion that he was acting cowardly, and that he did it primarily as a favor to his longtime friend, Father Pat O'Brien. In the process he was able to help the young gang of thugs re-think their futures as well.",10,13,True

tt0029870,A wonderful example of the Warner Brothers gangster flick of the 1930s,8.0,"This movie was very, very similar to MANHATTAN MELODRAMA (MGM--1934), though this film combined this earlier flick with the Dead End Kids (an earlier incarnation of the East Side Kids or the Bowery Boys). Both films featured a smart and street-wise hood who is very likable (Gable and Cagney), a close fried who believes in them (William Powell as the DA and Pat O'Brien as a priest) and an ending in which the thug ""does the right thing"". As I said, the big difference was the addition of the Dead End Kids--as young punks who idolize Jimmy Cagney. And while I usually HATED the Dead End Kids/Bowery Boys/East Side Kids, in this film they were a pretty welcome addition, as they were used less as comic relief and more as integral parts of the story. Because of this, Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall (stars in the later incarnations of ""the kids"") were less stupid, annoying and important to the gang--being secondary characters at best.The story and acting is pure 1930s Warner Brothers gangster fare. While some might find this very, very formulaic and even dull, I like the predictability because the production values are so high and the films are just plain fun.

tt0029870,Angels or Evils?,8.0,"This is one of my favorite classics, with extraordinary acting of James Cagney, one of the best actors starring crime films, and his friend, Pat O'Brien, who once again played the role of a priest. In fact, O'Brien in his real life studied to become a priest, but later he quit for becoming an actor. The seed of criminality is here well shown, but not its causes. Why are these children finally criminals? It was not the intention of the director Michael Curtiz to go deeply into the problem, instead he treated it religiously. Men are products of the society where they live, obviously, some escape from bad examples while others continue to be spoiled for the whole life. Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) was the case, a spoiled child with some principles of friendship only, and hard with his enemies. His best friend (o'Brien) hopefully became a priest and took the life differently, trying to help and improve the behavior of the children in the community where he lives. Why one went in one way different to the other? this is not suggested in the film. We have only the facts and then you must figure out the reasons of such behaviors.

tt0029870,Good and bad,10.0,"Had a lot of high hopes for 'Angels With Dirty Faces'. There are many great gangster films out there, some cinematic milestones, and when one talks about actors that excelled in this type of film James Cagney is somewhere near the top of the list. Really like to love a lot of Michael Curtiz's, a great and very versatile director, films, especially 'Casablanca', 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' and 'Mildred Pierce' and even lesser efforts are watchable.'Angels With Dirty Faces' blew me away. It is up there with the best gangster films of all time to me and many others, which is evident from how massively influential it is and how often it's imitated. 'Angels With Dirty Faces' is also one of Curtiz's best films, well certainly among my favourites of his as of now anyway, one of Cagney's finest hours and has an ending (justifiably near-universally lauded) that left a huge impression on me emotionally.It is a wonderful looking film, Curtiz's films were always well made and his visual style was actually pretty unique at the time. While the production design is atmospheric and the lighting very artistic and moody, it was the cinematography that left me spellbound. Not just the stunning composition and how much it enhanced the atmosphere but also the use of camera angles, very varied kinds without being gimmicky and it is always fluid and ambitious.Max Steiner's score swells sumptuously and thrillingly and is very haunting and effectively dramatic. Without being intrusive or strident. Curtiz's direction is exemplary, the classy stylishness and boldness evident throughout. It shines especially at the end, well pretty much everything shines at this point. The script is gritty and lean yet also sophisticated and sincere. Some of it is quotable too.The story has so much great with it too. It is fast paced and appropriately tough as nails, while also having emotional impact. The chemistry between Cagney and Pat O'Brien and Cagney and Humphrey Bogart have sincerity and hard boiled tension and the moral, one still having a lot of truth now, makes its point without beating one around the head. The shoot out is thrilling and suspensefully staged, and the Dead End Kids' moments have heart and levity, but the highlight dramatically is the ending. Can't begin to tell you how powerful it is, my gut was practically wrenched watching it and after my heart was ripped into two. The characters are interesting, even though Rocky was very flawed it was hard to hate him.Cagney is magnificent and shows why his reputation as an icon in gangster films is richly deserved. It is an intense and bold yet oddly likeable performance and one of his best, his acting at the end is some of the best he ever did. O'Brien is sincere and a powerful contrast while Bogart plays a weasel of a character pretty chillingly. The Dead End Kids add a lot too.Altogether, brilliant. 10/10",5,6,False
tt0029870,Magnetic Cagney,,"The story here is that Cagney is the gangster 'star' of the East Side, with a group of young hoodlums looking up to him, the same as movie-going kids who'd come to see the film. His priest friend from the old days wants him to help him put the kids on the right track. We know that he's basically a stand-up guy, a good soul, partly corrupted by the 'system'. In the end he agrees to die 'yellow', tarnishing his reputation so the kids will renounce gangster heroism.That's it in a nutshell. It isn't a bad movie, it's just that the study is so screamingly obvious, full of catechism aimed at us and reducing us to childlike goofs who know no better. It's nice enough at the start, the East Side world it portrays is thick. But it becomes such a thin message movie in the second half. Just not worth the time.Cagney though is magnetic as usual, a terrific guy. He could sing, tap dance, seduce; later on he was a judo blackbelt. Watch him slap Bogart around, here playing the mousey lawyer villain. It's clear there's no comparing them. Cagney was the real deal and this is all about his presence.

How a man can be reduced to a gibbering, blubbering mess in such circumstances is very believable. It is obvious that he was all talk and is really a great yellow-belly. To beg and scream like this is not dignified and proves that his yellow streak is formidable. I have never seen such cowardice on screen before and Cagney does it well. He was born to play these yellow type characters. He played yellowbellys in most of his films, no? Very good. As a child, I was haunted by a grown man in hysterical mode, screaming, crying and shaking like a shithouse.. Very shocking, indeed. I guess he got his just desserts but to display such a blubbering mess to his captors is very weak. For certain.I was relieved when they pulled the lever to silence him once and for all.

It's like a Romanesque mosaic. Here's Jimmy Cagney as Rocky Sullivan, the ex-choir boy gangster who hitches up his pants and greets people with, ""Whaddaya hear, whaddaya say?"" His childhood pal is Pat O'Brian, now a priest living in the same neighborhood and trying to save the new generation of kids from turning into hoodlums. We have the Dead End Kids (or whatever they're called here) who think Cagney is a swell guy. Humphrey Bogart is Cagney's lawyer who swindles him out of his stash, then tries to have him killed when Cagney is released from jail. The familiar girl with the pig tails grows up to be Anne Sheridan, who has big, pretty eyes but no New York accent. (Neither does Pat O'Brian, from Wisconsin, but I've given him absolution.) After the final shoot out, with Cagney's foes dead and himself trapped in a tenement with tear gas coming through the windows, O'Brian shows up and takes the speaker. ""Rocky, you've got to come out!"" ""Go on back to da choitch where ya belong, Fodder!"" (I just made that line up, but there are a couple of similar ones in the scene.) Rocky is convicted and sentenced to death. But he's a tough guy and won't break down. The Dead End Kids mope over the headlines and promise themselves that Rocky will never turn yellow at the end. O'Brian gets word of this and tells Rocky that he holds the fate of these innocent kids in his hands. If he doesn't turn yellow as he's marched to the chair, the kids will turn into miscreants. If he shows he's frightened, his myth will die with him and the kids will all become champion polo players overnight.Does Rocky develop a social conscience in his last moments and fake hysteria as he walks the last mile? Guess.The thing is, this isn't anybody's best performance and it is no one's idea of the tightest script, yet you can gain a rather full grasp of what these genre movies were all about by watching this single movie, and not having to sit through half a dozen others.

tt4379632,Highly Original,10.0,"I have to say this series really surprised me with its contents of the strange, awesome, and twisted story plot. New York is the setting where a dimensional rift has set up a bubble of a sort that those from another dimension and humans coexist in the same city. But to keep the peace a select few demons and humans work together to solve mysteries that occur as supernatural events. In the middle of the chaos is one man (Leo) who has the gift to alter the present as he sees fit. With eyes that are from an ancient god he is able to alter or traverse matter to his will. Aided with him are his troupe of hunters who also have various gifts that help in the face of evil.Yet through out his entire life Leo has never once paired up with a girl to make his life just a bit easier than it is now. Seeing as this was no obvious threat he meets one woman who will change his life either for the worse, or for the better depending on his view. His eyes are also sought after by the darkness for which he needs protection most of the time since his ability is just to change courses of matter or time. Except when he does use his gift his eyes sometimes blur out, which he cannot control.All in all I say this is an interesting series. It combines aspects of ridiculous chaos but to the troupe it's all in a days work. They take everything with a grain of salt in order to keep their sanity. It has also pin point aspects to another series called Cowboy Beebop with its rambunctious characters who look evil in the eye and say... ""Neh what the hell.""The music is top notch, the action is gratuitous in all ways, and the scenery is very gritty, which coincides to the working classes both dimensional or human. As they say the rich get richer and the poor always rebel. In either case Kekkai Sensen is in my view a very funny, and down to earth series with blends of the strange, mixing with unknown elements to give rise to a new cult classic.

The action is not the focus of the show, it is the unique characters that make up the group. The action is the icing on the cake done brilliantly by Studio Bones as always.

Tracy however beautifully underplays against Rooney. San Francisco two years before was a milestone film for Tracy. Previous to San Francisco, Tracy had played mostly roughewn types on either side of the law. No pun intended, but as the priest there, Spencer Tracy became the wise paternal figure so beloved in so many films. There's a lot of Father Tim Mullin continued on in Tracy's Father Flanagan. No new ground was broken, but the ground was carefully cultivated by Tracy in Boys Town, earning him a second Oscar in a row.

Excellent production values - with outdoor filming that actually appears to have taken place on location at the authentic Boys Town - help tremendously with the viewer's enjoyment.Earning his second Oscar in two years, Spencer Tracy is magnificent as the good Father. He gives us a hero of patience & grace, one who values prayer & faith, but one who is also quite ready to land a few powerful punches for a good cause. Tracy's own private life was anything but tranquil, which only makes his performance here all the more impressive.Admirably cast as a nasty little punk, young Mickey Rooney breezes through an important role which would help propel him into becoming Hollywood's top star within a couple of years. Like a junior version of Tracy himself, the two are wonderful together, striking several dramatic sparks off their characters' personalities.

With a shoestring budget, and the aid of practical but good hearted businessman Dave Morris (Henry Hull), Flanagan begins the task of building a home and a legacy for hundreds of troubled young men.Flanagan soon meets Whitey Marsh (Mickey Rooney), a street wise punk who is about to follow in the footsteps of his criminal brother; but it was big brother Joe (Edward Norris) who asks Flanagan to befriend Whitey. At first, Whitey wants none of it, but there always seems to be something holding Whitey back, whether the thought of a good meal, the effort to make an impression on the other boys, or just the friendship of another young boy Pee Wee (Bobs Watson) who looks up to Whitey. Rooney gives an incredibly fine performance here, portraying a wide range of character and emotions. His near breakdown when Pee Wee is injured and the thought that he was responsible is enough to cause a tear jerk reaction. The film does get a bit simplistic at times, and some of the situations seem contrived to keep the story moving. But it's anchored by a sense of faith and hope in Father Flanagan's crusade to make the world just a little bit better for one boy at a time. In that, the film has a timeless appeal, and resonates as strongly today as it must have in the late 1930's.",19,23,True

tt0029942,A little too saintly to be entertaining,5.0,"The film takes a long time to get going - I almost gave up on it after the first half-hour. But mercifully, after the documentary-style and resolutely non-judgmental opening, ""Boys Town"" acquires a plot - and some sense of direction. The trigger for this is the introduction of the first character in the entire film who is allowed to be flawed. So far, everyone else has been shown to be either a curmudgeon with a heart of gold, a rascal with a heart of gold, or an unashamed saint; but Joe Marsh is a flashy and unrepentant young criminal.He is not entirely beyond redemption, however. He loves his younger brother, who hero-worships him in turn and longs to emulate him; and it is doubtless a sad reflection on human nature that it is only with the arrival of strife in the Eden of Boys Town, in the shape of Joe and Whitey Marsh, that the film manages to become at all interesting.What follows is a story that has been told many times before, from Louisa May Alcott's ""Jo's Boys"" onwards. This is the story of a rough boy who rebels against unaccustomed gentle surroundings and tries to corrupt his new world to match the one he knows, and whose ultimate saving grace is his protective love for a younger child.The main problem for this film is the role of Father Flanagan, a thankless part for any actor. The man has - literally - no weaknesses, no human flaws, not even any self-doubt. His charm can apparently melt the hardest heart and conjure water out of a stone - or out of a hard-headed pawnbroker, which according to the script comes to the same thing. The man is too likeable to be 'insufferable'; but it was surely not the intention of the director that the audience should end up by willing Whitey to resist the priest's moral pressure, to shield his brother even at his own expense and that of his adopted community - and to be so pleased when the boy attempts to do so.To be honest, I don't see that this part deserved to win an Oscar for Spencer Tracy - not because the actor played badly, but because the character as written simply doesn't present him with enough challenging material to demonstrate his craft. It is the child actors who play the various boys who deserved the real praise in this film. Ultimately I suspect Tracy's Oscar was an award aimed at rewarding the efforts of the *real* Father Flanagan rather than at his performance in this film.",13,19,False

But the order in Boys Town is marred by the reluctant entry of Whitey Marsh (played effortlessly by Mickey Rooney), a cocky street-smart urchin who loathes having to adjust his ways to suit the others. However, as the events unwind, Whitey slowly starts loving Boys Town so much so that he stakes his life for it.

As his toughest charge, Mickey Rooney is way over the top, and continually irritating. Half-way through the movie I was sincerely hoping he'd get bumped off. The few virtues this film possesses have to do with its intention, which is to tell us about Father Flanagan, which it does proficiently. Production values are outstanding, also, but the acting of the Young Ones leaves much to be desired, and one wishes the Dead End Kids, who had debuted in films the previous year, had turned up at some point and rocked the boat a little, showing us just how tough young deprived and neglected youngsters can be, and how much mischief they can make.

Father Flanagan performed a wonderful service during his 62 years on earth and we should be grateful for that self sacrifice. Thanks to Father Flanagan, the world is a better place and children are cared for in the way that they deserve.

He was only 18, but he was so talented!  In this, he really shows the audience what an incredible actor he is.  I think he should have won an Oscar too!;My favorite part of ""Boys Town"" is when Pee Wee gets hit by a car, and Whitey really shows his emotions for the first time.  This part really just rips my heart out, to see a tough kid like Whitey just fall apart.  Pee Wee was the only boy who stood by Whitey right from the start: his only true friend.  But thank goodness Pee Wee lives!~""Boys Town"" is a movie that really defines the Golden Era of Hollywood by displaying a wonderful cast and a beautiful story.

tt0029942,An overwrought moralizing storyline brought down even further by unbearable over-acting,2.0,"I didn't mind the overall story here. It was full of cliche and very predictable. A lot of cheesy lines and lame jokes (the pitiful dialog and exaggerated behavior of the cops and newspaper people), and 90% of characters are cardboard cutouts.Still, it would be entertaining enough if it wasn't for the pukefest of a performance given by one Mickey Rooney. This is my first exposure to him other than 60 minutes, and I can now see why he was relegated to doing those hack comedy bits on a tv news magazine. (Why was that ever even a thing? Journalism sure has been dying for a long time..) He simply stinks. Every scene he's in, and I mean **every single scene**, he ruins with his constant mugging and jittering. None of his emotions are believable besides his anger.

tt0029942,Boys Town Gang,4.0,"Normally I'm a big fan of social commentary features from vintage Hollywood. Often including priests in the cast as some sort of moral compass or bell-weather for troubled individuals to tap into or rub up against as appropriate, depending on how their characterisations are handled, they can either add to or subtract from the bigger picture. I've just lately watched two old contemporary features featuring sub-plots with prominent priest parts where both see the Father mentoring rebellious youths, one the classic James Cagney / Pat O'Brien gangster film ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", the other, ""San Francisco"" in fact co-starring Spencer Tracy in what looks like a dry-run for his extended part here.In this film though, it's all about the Father and his adopted sons, the homeless, sometimes delinquent youths who come to populate the self-reliant and sufficient community he builds for them called ""Boys Town"" (wonder what happened to the girls, or the black kids come to that?). While I appreciate the story is based on the real life Father Flanagan, I'm afraid I found this movie just too sentimental and cloying to appreciate.I see that Tracy won the Oscar for leading actor in this part, just as he had for the supporting actor role in the near-identical part mentioned above in ""San Francisco"" but really other than mostly look alternately beatific and pious, I'm not sure he's working too hard here. Mickey Rooney is the bad boy who becomes the Father's big test subject, sent to Boys Town by his too-far-gone older gangster brother to stop him going down the same rocky road as him. Mickey, as was his wont in his early roles, it has to be said works way too hard in his part. There's also a Tiny Tim child character who will either have you reaching or retching into your handkerchief, for me I'm afraid it's the latter.A huge commercial hit on initial release and as stated, recognised by the Academy into the bargain, it's rare for such a film to miss with old sentimental me but I really found it toe-curlingly cliched and difficult to swallow.Forgive me Father, if in so doing, I have sinned.",5,8,False

This was Tracy's second Best Actor Oscar in a row and he's the best thing about the film, even if neither Oscar-winning performance represented anything like his best work. A young Mickey Rooney pulls out all the stops as one of the boys who comes his way and proves to be a tough nut to crack.

tt0029942,Mickey Rooney saves the day,7.0,"A lot of especially younger people today are going to despise 'Boys Town' for its unashamed sentimentality, and the objection is hard to contradict. Even the director Lasse Hallström who doesn't shy away from overt emotion in his movies would, I hope, steer away from some of the grosser clichés of this picture.Having said that, I found 'Boys Town' truly engrossing. It is, of course, about Father Flanagan (Spencer Tracy) who sets up a self-governed community for wayward, homeless boys in Nebraska, a sort of humanitarian answer to the often brutal and authoritarian reformatories. Flanagan's biggest challenge proves to be Whitey (Mickey Rooney), tough and self-serving kid brother of a convicted felon. Though Flanagan repeatedly claims 'I only know one thing, There's no such thing as a bad boy"", Whitey's surely testing his patience and ends up endangering the whole future of the enterprise.Actually, and that came as a shock to me, Rooney's Whitey was the surprise of the movie. Whereas Tracy is going through the motions as the archetypal priest with a heart of gold, and whereas too many of the boys are acted with the sort of saccharine sweetness that must have been grating even in the mid- or late 1930s, Rooney is perfect. I myself never gave him credit for his versatility, his instinct and his willingness to take risks. From his initial streetwise swagger (when told that ""On a clear day you can see all the way to Omaha"", he retorts, ""Yeah? THEN whadda ya got?"") he gradually, so gradually as to be believable, evolves into a decent young chap. The scene in which he falls apart, because he believes he has caused the death of a hero-worshiping little boy, rings very true in its sobbing and crying earnestness. The director, alas, ends up destroying the honesty of the scene by applying scores of boys kneeling in fervent prayer, with a soprano soaring above them all.All in all, 'Boys Town' ought to have been a whole lot better. Another director would have helped. It's a nice touch, though, to have the scrawny destitute kid hitch for a week to get to Boys Town only the night before it is destined to foreclose.So, watch it for Rooney and the occasional touching ensemble scene.",4,8,False
tt0029942,A sugary saccharine confection,6.0,"Spencer Tracy won the Academy Award for Most Sincere Priest of 1938 for this one. He drifts through a range of emotions here from pious sincerity to pious righteousness to pious tolerance via pious determination and resourcefulness  all of it smothered in a sickly dose of pious non-sexual love for his ever growing brood of ankle-biters. In real life Tracy is one of the cussing-est, hard-drinking womanisers in Hollywood and it must have amused him no end to have received an Oscar for his portrayal of the saintly Father Flanagan.The film takes a left turn halfway through, as if it has grown tired of watching the rather dull father, to concentrate on the problems endured by Whitey Marsh, played by an 18-year-old Mickey Rooney. Rooney clearly thinks he's in a comedy. Just look at the way he struts around as the mayor of Boys Town shows him around the town; he lifts each leg as if he has glue on the soles of his shoes and twitches his head this way and that like a particularly alert sparrow. Later, when things go particularly bad for his character, Rooney overacts outrageously, determined to tug at the heartstrings of all those mothers who had made him one of America's favourite teens.Of course, this being a Hollywood product of the thirties, everything works out OK in the end. Father Flanagan saves the boys' home from closure, Whitey becomes accepted and liked by his peers, all of whom are wonderfully likable young tykes ('there's no such thing as a bad boy,' Tracy repeatedly intones), and little Pee Wee, inspired by Tracy, goes on to become a real-life Methodist minister.This one's so sugary you're going to want to brush your teeth after watching it.",4,7,True

tt0030395,Swiss Miss,9.0,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ""Mad About Music"" (Universal, 1938), directed by Norman Taurog, is Deanna Durbin's third feature film, and ranks one of her finest in many ways, especially with a delightful storyline and Durbin's likable charm, but unfortunately, this is one overlooked treasure from the golden age of teenage musicals.The story opens with Gwen Taylor (Gail Patrick), a celebrated movie actress, placing her hand prints in the cement block at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Unknown to many, Gwen has been separated from her daughter for ten years because of her great popularity, and finds that she cannot reveal to her fans that a glamor girl like herself is a mother of a 14-year-old girl. Gloria Harkinson (Deanna Durbin), the daughter in question, is being educated at a Swiss school for girls. Well liked by her classmates, she is immensely disliked by one in particular, Felice (Helen Parrish), who is not only jealous of her popularity around school, but is very eager to learn more about Gloria's questionable family background, especially when she refuses to believe that Gloria's father is a famous African explorer. To cover up her lies, Gloria has her middle-aged friend, Pierre (Christian Rub) back her up by writing letters to her, signing them from ""her Dad."" Because her little white lies are getting her deeper and deeper in trouble, Gloria, realizing that she is being followed by her classmates as she is heading for the train station, suddenly approaches a man named Richard Todd (Herbert Marshall), and his valet, Tripps (Arthur Treacher). Before Todd realizes what has happened, the distinguished gentleman finds himself suddenly acting as Gloria's father and coming to her school where he impresses the girls by talking about his ""hunting adventures in Africa."" More problems arise when Gloria learns that her mother is visiting in Paris, and must manage to sneak away from the school without arousing any more attention.The storyline to ""Mad About Music"" may sound corny in print, but in reality, it is highly amusing and entertaining throughout its 98 minutes screen time, and it's easy to see why Durbin became such a box office attraction, having both voice and personality. The supporting cast consists of a younger William Frawley playing Dusty Turner, Gwen Taylor's agent; Marcia Mae Jones as Olga, Gloria's best friend; Elisabeth Risdon as the school official; Jackie Moran and Charles Peck as military academy students interested in Gloria and Olga; Franklin Pangborn seen briefly as the hotel manager; plus a cameo appearance by Sidney Grauman of Grauman's Chinese Theater in the opening segment of the story. One scene finds Frawley's character in a sentimental moment as he tells Gloria that she mustn't see her mother, as much as he knows in his heart that seeing her mother would mean a lot to her. The way this scene is handled is well done, showing the warmer side of Frawley, a fine character actor known for his grumpiness and his sarcastic comedic one-liners, especially used to great advantage in the immortal long running TV series from the 1950s, ""I Love Lucy,"" starring Lucille Ball. It is also interesting to see the young and sassy Gail Patrick cast against type playing a mother.New songs by Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh include: ""I Love to Whistle,"" ""Ave Maria"" (by Charles Francois Gounod); ""Chapel Bells"" ""I Love to Whistle"" and ""Serenade to the Stars."" Aside from Durbin's singing, the Capps Barros Harmonica Players also participate in a song number.""Mad About Music"" resembles the story lines used by MGM, especially those Jane Powell Technicolor musicals of the late 1940s, mainly because it was produced by Joe Pasternak, who brought over his charm of teenage musicals from Universal to MGM, revamping the formula he originated in the Durbin films. Universal-International would remake ""Mad About Music"" as ""The Toy Tiger"" (1956) featuring Jeff Chandler, Laraine Day and Tim Hovey in the Marshall, Patrick and Durbin roles.

Mad About Music has a crazy setup and for a good portion of the first act I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it. I understand the urge that kids feel to lie to their peers so that they aren't seen as different or lesser people. But the compounding fibs that Deanna Durbin's character tells in Mad About Music get to be more than any rational person's suspension of disbelief would allow. I was struggling to believe these girls thought she was being truthful in any way. However, once Herbert Marshall entered the film all was forgiven. Every far-fetched lie became worth it as he stumbled through becoming this man he was forced to portray.Perhaps even funnier than the situation created in Mad About Music are all the little scenes with Arthur Treacher who gets caught in the middle of everything and must try to figure out what is going on with his employer. Every single scene with him made me laugh, and it's often the little throwaway lines that I found the funniest. If I could help in rewriting this film at all, though, I would shave some time off the beginning and put it onto the ending. They spend a little too long building up the conflict between Durbin and the other girls in her school, and not long enough resolving her relationship with her mother. I was watching the clock as the reunion with her mom approached and I could tell there wasn't going to be enough time to make it feel as heartfelt and warm as I wanted.

Australian release: 26 May 1938. 10 reels. 96½ minutes.SYNOPSIS: Boarding school girl manufactures an explorer father.NOTES: Academy Award, Deanna Durbin, for her ""significant contribution in bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth and as a juvenile player setting a high standard of ability and achievement"".Also nominated for Original Story (Boys Town), Cinematography (The Great Waltz), Art Direction (The Adventures of Robin Hood), Music (Alexander's Ragtime Band).Remade in 1956 as The Toy Tiger.COMMENT: Despite its dated, old-hat story, ""Mad About Music"" is still amusing and entertaining. Fortunately, it is directed at a fast enough clip to maintain the interest and the cast is a delight. Christian Rub has a nice part which he plays to the hilt, while Pangborn makes entrances and exits in his usual splendidly flurried manner. Helen Parrish is most effective as the spiteful Felice, and — though he tends to overdo it — Treacher has some capital moments. Good old ever-reliable Herbert Marshall carries off his stooge role with customary ease.True, neither Gail Patrick nor William Frawley are particularly convincing, but — praise be! — their roles are limited to the front and end of the picture. As for Deanna, she is of course absolutely marvelous. At both singing and fibbing she is an absolute charmer. The songs are wonderfully pleasant.Production values are top-drawer (despite obvious Swiss mountain backdrops and a Paris process screen). Over-misty photography tends to date the film in some sequences, though Valentine's lighting is consistently most attractive. The fine sets deserved their Academy nomination.Noted around Hollywood for his easygoing nature and his ability to gain the confidence and rapport not only of his co-workers (they literally fought to get on his set) but of children, teenagers and ""difficult"" stars (like Elvis Presley), director Norman Taurog has handled all his chores with artistry and skill.",6,6,True
tt0030395,Is the Durbin version any better?,6.0,"One of Jane Powell's earliest films was ""Delightfully Dangerous"" and I was not exactly bowled over by it. Apparently, it was a remake of ""Mad About Music"" but instead of starring Powell, it starred Universal's big young singing star, Deanna Durbin.The film finds young Gloria at an exclusive girls school in Switzerland. It seems her mother is a Hollywood star who has dumped her there where she is very lonely. This is made worse by the school bully who inexplicably hates this sweet young lady. So, to combat boredom and being so alone, Gloria creates a fictional father...complete with all sorts of exploits. She tells the girls that he's a big game hunter in Africa...and the bully demands Gloria show that he's real, as the bully suspects Gloria's made him up...which she has. So, she could either come clean about him or continue with the lie...and so she doubles down and tells everyone he's coming for a visit! So, she then heads to the train station and convinces a total stranger (Herbert Marshall) to accompany her. He has no idea about the lie and her classmates, at least temporarily, are appeased. But this certainly can't go on forever...so what's next?This is an enjoyable film, though if you watch it there are two nagging problems that are bound to enter your mind. First, the man she convinces to be her father. He agrees to help her but there is no logical reason for this. Second, if you think about it, the idea of an adult man hanging out with a 14 year-old he doesn't even know AND tells everyone he's her father...well, that's mega-creepy! If you can manage to look past this, the film is enjoyable and fun...and weird.",0,4,False
tt0030395,Cute precursor to 'Kathleen',6.0,"In another delightful Deanna Durbin vehicle, she stars as a lonely girl in boarding school who lies about her parents. Her mother is a famous actress in Hollywood, but since she isn't allowed to let her fans know she's old enough to have a teenaged daughter (orders of her manager William Frawley) she forces Deanna to keep it a secret. With no father to talk about either, Deanna makes one up. She forges letters and finds fake photographs, making up stories that her father is an explorer on safari, entertaining most of the girls in her school. One girl, Helen Parrish, doesn't believe her, and she humiliates Deanna by exposing one of the fake photographs. Spurred on, Deanna lies and pretends her father is coming to visit her at the school!Armed with a bouquet of flowers and all her classmates behind her, she goes to the train station to wait for an unsuspecting man traveling alone. In walks Herbert Marshall - and the stage is set. It's no wonder Herbert Marshall was cast as Shirley Temple's father in 1941's Kathleen, a film with a very similar premise. He's just delightful and perfect casting as a father figure. I love him in comedies, for he's so charming and sweet. He manages to make it look like he's amused without breaking character, with is a thin line to cross.Deanna's lovely voice is showcased in this movie, of course, and you'll get to see some lovely Hollywood sets of Switzerland. Elisabeth Risdon is the headmistress of the school, Arthur Treacher is Bart's manservant, and Marcia Mae Jones is Deanna's best friend. This one isn't as funny as Kathleen, but it is a good precursor and entertaining every time Bart opens his mouth.",4,4,False
tt0030395,Feelgood film,8.0,"One of Deanna Durbin's early films, and one that showcases her acting and singing abilities like few others do. Watch out for how her facial expression changes when Herbert Marshall is about to expose her storytelling and then re-considers, or when she sings the serenade to the stars and is about to burst into tears. She was definitely one of the best teenage actors Hollywood ever attracted. Her singing is awesome, too, especially Gounod's Ave Maria: I never heard it sung better. Herbert Marshall is perfect for the role of willing Ersatz-father, and it is a pleasure to see Gail Patrick cast against type. Still, it is Deanna's film - next to her, all others, no matter how experienced, are no more than supporting actors.",3,3,False

Gloria lives in an all-girls boarding school in Switzerland. She never met her late navy pilot father but has fabricated a fictional living father to the other girls. She is forced to construct more and more elaborate lies until she picks Richard Todd (Herbert Marshall) at random to play the part. Luckily, he is willing to play along.This got four smaller Oscar nominations. Deanna Durbin is cute and sweet. She's showing off her operatic voice. The whistle song is pretty catchy although too much of it can be very repetitive. The story has some teen girl mayhem which reminds me of various Disney teen misadventures.

Fourteen years later, Miss Patrick (who was ten years older than Miss Durbin) is a successful glamor star, and her daughter is Deanna Durbin at a girls school in Switzerland, who makes up stories about her father, the explorer.After some issues with her fellow student, Miss Durbin is with them at the train station, and announces Herbert Marshall is her father. He goes along with the gag, but Miss Durbin keeps showing up, much to the confusion of his valet, Arthur Treacher. They part, but then Deanna learns her mother is going to be performing in Paris, so off she goes, only to run in again to Marshall.Little Miss Fix-it eventually fixes everything, sing ""Ave Maria"" and ""I Love To Whistle"", charms groundskeeper Christian Rub, and so does everything that her fans loved to see her doing.

tt0030395,"Deanna Durbin's Third Big Hit, Starring an A-Listed Actor",8.0,"Universal Pictures spared no expense when it came to support its new teen sensation. After her first two movies became socko hits, the studio went all out in Deanna Durbin's third film, February 1938's ""Mad About Music."" Universal just re-signed Durbin to an adult-like salary of $1,250 per week with a $10,000 bonus for each of the films she made, an astronomical figure in those days for a girl just turning 16.Durbin is known as the actress who saved Universal from bankruptcy. Her ""Mad About Music"" was 13th in the year's box office rankings. The film gave her a boast in confidence after rejected by Walt Disney as the voice of Snow White after he felt her voice was ""too old"" for the part. The studio assigned the Durbin film A-listed Herbert Marshall, whose services were much sought after, to play her fictitious father. Contemporary columnist Edwin Schallert noted, ""The demand for Herbert Marshall's talents continues to spread far and wide. Even the newer and younger leading women, it is felt, need to have his proficient romanticism displayed in their pictures.""Universal spent a ton of buckaroos to construct a Swiss village on its studio lot for ""Mad About Music,"" where Durbin's character Gloria Taylor attends school in Switzerland. Her mother in the film, Gwen (played by Gail Patrick, who was in real life only 10 years older than Durbin), is a Hollywood star whose studio as well as her manager Dusty Turner (William Frawley) want to keep secret the fact she has a daughter. Gloria's father died in the war when she was a baby, but incredulously she feels the need to invent a story that her father is alive and is a big-time explorer. One of her so-called friends, Felice (Helen Parrish), doesn't believe her story, forcing Gloria to say her father's arriving on a train to visit her. She picks a man at random at the station, who happens to be Richard Todd (Marshall), a music composer. Once he discovers Gloria's predicament, he goes along with her tall tale, with hilarious results.Norman Taurog had just finished directing the first color-film version of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer in 1938's ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."" ""Mad About Music"" showcased several Durbin songs, including one backed by The Vienna Boys Choir, touring in California at the time of the production.The Academy Awards nominated ""Mad About Music"" in five categories, including Best Art Direction for the Swiss village sets. Joseph Valentine earned a nomination for Best Cinematography, Frank Skinner and Charles Previn (Andre's cousin) for Best Music Scoring, and Marcella Burke and Frederick Kohner for Best Original Story.",0,0,False
tt0030848,"Watch The First 40 Minutes, Then Shut It Off",3.0,"The first 40 minutes features some sharp, witty dialog, much of it by Myrna Loy as she puts down the arrogant Clark Gable.Then the story just gets too silly and begins to bog down with a one-day romance that results in marriage, of course (only in Hollywood!). Then you get a predictable death scene and then Gable shown winning a big race. However, after the race he goes on a four-day drunk with no explanation of why he did it.The film continues with this kind of stupidity and ovedoner melodramatics by both Gable and Loy, ruining what started out to be a very promising two-hour film. Instead, after awhile I just couldn't wait for this to end. Not recommended.",20,44,True
tt0030848,A waste of time,2.0,"I expected a lot more from this movie considering its cast.  With Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and Spencer Tracy, I thought there would at LEAST be good acting.  The plot was interesting but poorly executed.  Gable's character is a test pilot for the army, and tends to enjoy the ""high life.""  Loy, his wife, is often left anxious over his safety and doubtful of their love. Tracy has probably the best performance of the trio as the friend and sometimes co-pilot of Gable.  However, for the bulk of the movie, all Tracy has to do is be depressed.  His character had the potential to be very interesting; there seemed to be a lot of internal conflict within him that was poorly projected upon the screen.  Loy and Gable are often excessively over-dramatic.  It becomes nauseating after a while, especially with such contrived and ridiculous dialogue.  The only entertaining interaction between Gable and Loy was at the beginning, when they were slyly flirtatious and coy with each other.Maybe this movie was considered good when it was released, but it certainly hasn't worn well with time.",11,36,False
tt0030848,Impressive for 1938,10.0,"I've only seen this movie twice, but I guess I forgot how good the dialogue is until I watched it the second time the other day. Most films from around this time were teetering on the B edge, but this one is very well done. Mostly, though, it was the way the script was written (or the way they ad libbed it) that really made the movie. It's clever but not overdone and definitely not sappy. The way they talk to each other, especially Ann and Gunner, works in such a way as to keep you guessing and not having any idea what they may say next. I was not expecting to see that but it's very effective. Most of the rest of the movies from this genre were your stereotype typicals, and you don't get into this kind of dialogue until well into the 40s and on into the 50s. I was impressed.Loy and Gable work very well together and don't leave anything to be desired. The chemistry, as they say, is obvious. I don't know of any other movies they starred in together, but I'm definitely going to look! Spencer Tracy shows his vesatility in this one, and his humor is one of my favorite things about him. All said and done, I'll be watching ""Test Pilot"" again and again and recommend it to old-movie fans.",26,35,False
tt0030848,Gable and Tracy and Barrymore and Loy! Great Movie!,9.0,"What a fantastic movie! This shows Clark Gable at his peak, just a year before Gone with the Wind, and Spencer Tracy near his beginning. With masterful directing on the part of Victor Fleming, cameras put you in the pilot's seat as you do barrel rolls and loops and dives. Gable and Tracy's beautiful friendship embraces their love of flying, and the two are inseparable, even after Myrna Loy enters the picture. Gable and Tracy act extremely well together, so it's surprising to me that this is their only movie together. Myrna Loy is a delight, as she is a departure from the eye candy role women traditionally played in those days. She actually acts, and she does it very well. And of course there is the immortal Lionel Barrymore, playing the same role of Mr. Potter in It's a Wonderful Life, but without the greed. And, surprisingly, he offers very touching, and very accurate advice to Gable in the end. A great movie, a joy to watch again and again!",21,34,False
tt0030848,What Would You do if Clark Gable Landed in your back yard?,7.0,"Clark Gable is the one in the title role and Spencer Tracy is his best friend and mechanic. Test Pilot portrays a footloose and fancy free Gable doing a dangerous job because he's entranced by the beauty and danger of flying. Tracy is along to give him a reality check every now and then.While trying for a coast to coast record Gable has trouble with a fuel line and has to make a landing in a Kansas wheat field that just happens to belong to Myrna Loy's parents. She's the farmer's daughter all right. Of course a little of that Gable charm and she's off in the wild blue yonder with him and spends the rest of the film worried about his daredevil behavior. She's not in Kansas any more.This was the second of the three Gable/Tracy co-starrers. All three of them, San Francisco, Test Pilot, and Boom Town have withstood the test of time and have become classics. Test Pilot's original story was written by Frank ""Spig"" Wead who's life story was brought to us in the film Wings of Eagles. Wead was a flyer himself until a fall in his home left him a paraplegic. After that he became a writer and several of his stories were filmed. In fact Gable and starred in Night Flight earlier on which was written by Wead. Of course Wead had a great feel for the type and character of the people who chose aviation as a career.The aerial sequences are first rate and the players settle comfortably in their parts.

tt0030848,Testing for World War Two,,"This film is essentially about testing planes for the war that anyone who even had a passing interest in international affairs knew was unavoidable, World War Two. The plot deals with the experimental phase of flying military equipment, of which the United States had inferior quality and little quantity in 1938. In the interest of progress, test pilots were willing to take to the air and strain both themselves and their equipment beyond normal bounds. The mythology is enhanced by the prologue in terms of the lack of the publication of ""the specifications of government aircraft."" It is probably just as well since America's enemies generally had better aircraft before the American involvement, except perhaps for the C-47 and the B-17. This initial disclaimer only sharpens the fiction of the film. The movie is worth a look if one is even mildly interested in aircraft lore.",14,19,False
tt0030848,"Smart movie, great acting",8.0,"I just watched this for the first time. It starts as a light romantic comedy and becomes deeper as the story evolves. The dialogue is especially well-written, fast-paced and witty. Myrna Loy's performance is a stand-out - not to slight Gable and Tracy in any way! - with nuance that grows more complex as the movie progresses. I was particularly impressed by the screenwriter's skill in developing the relationships among the three lead characters; Tracy's gradual love and respect for Loy; Gable's discovering the depth of his feelings for her; and her struggle to be the wife of a man who constantly puts himself in harm's way. It's the kind of measured (thoughtful, not boring) film that rarely gets made today, when the emphasis would be on the action scenes. Just an excellent, intelligent film all 'round.",17,18,False
tt0030848,Some great aviation sequences BUT...,6.0,"... the script crashes and burns. Gable plays a test pilot who crash lands in Myrna Loy's corn field. A whirlwind courtship ensues and the couple flies back from whence Gable came, except they are married. Gable loses his job because of his delay, but soon picks up another one as test pilot. When one of Gable's friends dies in an aerial contest - the audience has met the entire family right before the contest so you KNOW it is curtains for this guy - suddenly Myrna Loy realizes the danger of her husband's profession. Really? He did crash land in your cornfield. The only reason that didn't kill him is your cornfield was not a high rise! So why am I giving this six out of ten? Well there are some cute scenes, such as when Gable returns with his new wife and realizes that she needs a night gown for the wedding night. Loy could have done this shopping herself, but it did make for a cute scene with a bewildered Gable lost in the clutches of the lingerie department of a local store. Much more romantic than 80 years later with strangers hooking up on Tinder like they are ordering steel belted radials and all of the romance of buying tires to boot.Then there is the acting. Loy is sharp, witty and at the same time touching and unaffected. Gable is masculine, gruff but vulnerable, a sort of trial run for Rhett Butler, and with the same director as in ""Gone with the Wind"" too. As for Spencer Tracy, as Gable's mechanic and buddy I can't say it was a bad performance he gave, but it was the oddest one I've ever seen after Tracy left Fox and came to MGM. He plays it like he is Harpo Marx, practically mute for the entire movie. In fact that is exactly what it is like - as though Harpo Marx is wearing a Spencer Tracy suit.Victor Fleming directed this one, and Howard Hawks and Spig Wead were two of the four writers. Perhaps this one could have been more tightly delivered if Hawks had been the director.I'd mildly recommend this, but if you get through it, scratch your head, and say ""What exactly was the point of this?"" all I can say is you are not alone.",9,17,True
tt0030848,"Excellent Film with Gable, Tracy and Myrna Loy",,"This second pairing of Gable and Tracy was a great follow-up to the exciting ""San Francisco"" which was their first film together. Tracy was fast-becoming a very big star had an expanded role, but was still Gable's side-kick; something he would soon tire of. But all three stars, Gable, Tracy and Myrna Loy have a wonderful chemistry together. They play both the comedy and drama of the film with great ease and truthfulness. This trio, along with the wonderful Lionel Barrymore really make the film work.This isn't quite standard MGM fare. Underneath the fun-loving natures of the leads there is a slowly building sense of doom that begins to wear on them all. Tracy's character gives the tension a voice in his quietly stated mantram ""Three Roads"". As with the earlier film pairing, ""San Francisco"", ""Test Pilot"" was considered quite a fine action film with terrific special effects. Although, the latter suffers greatly in the special effects department today, while ""San Francisco"" still holds up quite well due to the excellent camera work, editing and creative special effects.There is one scene in particular that is fun to watch when you know the back story. It takes place rather early on with Gable driving a car with Loy sitting in front with him, and Tracy sitting in the back. The scene's lines are only between Loy and Gable with Tracy sort of listening and chewing gum. Gable was quoted after the premier complaining in an envious but lighthearted manner about that ""damn Tracy, we're acting our asses off, we have all the lines and he's still the only one you watch!"" Gable had a life-long respect for the great acting prowess of his co-star.Also look for Gable's last speech at the end of the film. While lecturing a group of air force recruits he suggests that the're either ""cracking wise or giving him the bird!"" The first time that gesture was ever mentioned on screen!A great 1930's MGM classic. Don't miss it!",17,17,True

Their chemistry, though less famous than William Powell and Myrna Loy, is great. The light and fun movies they did together are among my favorites of the 1930s. Now I am NOT saying they are the BEST, as there were many films that were more significant or realistic. But, sometimes I just want a film that is fun for fun's sake and doesn't necessarily have great depth. And you can't do a lot better than this film for just such a film. Wonderful acting, a cute plot and dialog and action combine to make a very enjoyable film that will most likely encourage you to look for more like it.",11,17,True
tt0030848,A Great Love Story,9.0,"Test Pilot surprised me with how good it is. As a love story, I rank it right up there with The Way We Were.Clark Gable plays a test pilot, Jim, who lives hard and fast. Like many who live on the edge, he is superstitious and has an addictive personality. To cope with the risks he must take, he never deals with his feelings and drowns his fears in excesses of liquor and women.Then he meets Ann, played by Myrna Loy--a fresh-faced, wisecracking Kansas girl who falls hard for the guy. Likewise, he falls for her and before you know it, they are married.After they are married, Ann learns quickly what life with Jim must be like. It is a harsh reality that she cannot shake; she loves the mug. Jim's sidekick is Gunner, a guy who also loves him but has learned to cope with Jim's short-sighted view of life. When Ann enters the picture, it becomes more than he can bear; he can endure his own pain, but cannot stand to witness hers.We see a love story that can only end in pain, made all the more painful because all three characters are lovable.The writing in this movie is among the best I have seen. There is not a false note in the entire film. It's difficult to write this kind of banter without making it seem false or shallow. Later in the film, when the going gets tougher, the writing conveys the feelings deep within even when they are talking only about the mundane.It has been written that Myrna Loy liked this film best of all she acted in. Personally, I would give her the Best Actress award for this performance, though she was not even nominated.Gable holds his own. And Tracy plays Gunner with a convincing subtlety.Victor Fleming, who directed The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind the very next year, had another winner in this one. I am surprised it does not get much mention.",12,13,False
tt0030848,Stylized film doing what it can with thirties audiences,,"Howard Hawks was a formidable talent with the typewriter and the movie crew. His other work, ""His Girl Friday"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"" are now considered classics of the thirties and of the genre,(screwball comedy), yet had the problem of not connecting with any significant success at the time. ""Test Pilot"" involves people who must choose not to be emotional because their very work involves cheating death with every job. So it becomes interesting to observe how a couple might handle their attraction for each other balanced by their need to deny fear at all times. One plot line here is similar to later pictures where the newly minted bride must turn to the local Army general with one question: how do I keep my man alive long enough to begin the marriage?Gable is not just a louse, but the biggest louse on the runway. Here louse would mean egomaniac: concerned only with himself and the job. He's got a best friend, Spencer Tracy, but they don't talk much about anything important. They signal instead with ""well, you know what I mean..."" and ""yeah, sure, sure I do. Uh-huh"" However the refreshingly good acting of Tracy underlines every scene that has him. Around this time, he took home the best actor Oscar for Captain's Courageous, a Metro picture directed by Victor Fleming, the Director of this film as well.Gable on the other hand, is so overstating everything, especially when his love interest Myrna Loy in on camera, that you wonder if he'll simply explode in all directions. She's just as bad matching him in near swoons and arms to the face movements. However the situations are sharp, multi-purpose affairs where you see the character learning if she can handle it or not. What's great is that watching it, you're not sure how things will turn out either.The psychology of the piece is complex and a bit dysfunctional, perfect for today's noir audience expectations, but probably unsettling for late-thirties audiences. The triangle is complicated by Gable's fascination with wrestling and controlling his rogue airplanes, something that Tracy and Loy only watch in equal amazement and attempt to reconcile with.",5,13,False
tt0030848,A failure,,"A weak film. To see its shortcomings, just compare it to Howard Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings,"" a masterful film made a year later dealing with many of the same emotional issues. For example, compare the death scenes in the two movies; ""Test Pilot"" is not in the same league. Clark Gable is too Clark Gable. He should have reigned in his persona a little more here; more subtlety in his character would have done the film a lot of good. But perhaps coming off of ""Parnell,"" a good movie but a bomb at the box office where he did depart from his typical macho character, he was less willing to take chances. Here, he does his typical macho character to the hilt.Myrna Loy is severely miscast as a Kansas girl whose backyard Gable uses for an emergency landing. She just looks too elegant, refined. Seeing her yelling and getting all excited at a baseball game just seems so out of character for her; an embarrassing scene. And like Gable, she over-emotes during most of the dramatic moments. Subtlety goes a long way; just ask Spencer Tracy.Of the three stars involved, Tracy comes out the best. His acting is the most naturalistic. Too bad he doesn't have a character. Just what exactly is his character's deal? Why is he hanging around Gable so much, blowing kisses at him as he takes off, living with him even after he's married. Is he related to Gable or just gay? I for one really don't like the pairing of Gable and Tracy. All three films they made together are weak (the first 40 minutes of ""Boom Town"" are good, but the movie quickly falls apart after that). In each, Gable is the unabashed, reckless, macho man, while Tracy is the morbid, grumpy, moral compass. Both actors deserve better and get better on their own. Perhaps ""Test Pilot"" would have been a much more satisfying movie with just Gable or just Tracy; with them together, it doesn't get off the ground. A disappointment, considering all the talent involved, in front of and behind the camera.",3,12,False
tt0030848,Sometimes Those Surly Bonds Look Like S&M.,6.0,"A product of MGM in its heyday, written by Frank ""Spig"" Wead, about whom John Ford was to later make a movie (""The Wings of Eagles""), directed by Victor Fleming, a man's man who barked orders, played rough, and boozed it up. Manly Clark Gable is the test pilot who always wants to push the envelope, even though he met and married the devoted Myrna Loy overnight. Spencer Tracy is the sidekick, there to provide common sense, worry about Gable, and maintain Gable's airplanes.With credits like that, it can't be all bad. Yet the characters are familiar. We've all seen movies before in which the hero is involved in some dangerous pursuit and the woman wants him to quit, settle down, and have babies in a normal home instead of all this running around with roughnecks -- and the drinking and swearing and the exhilaration of the adrenalin rush and all those tootsies hanging around and in general everybody carrying on like animals in a zoo. And why doesn't he get a haircut? She wants him to become a farmer or a shopkeeper or something, and start going to church, and she wants to push the perambulator along the sidewalks.Now, usually -- are you following this? -- usually the sidekick is homelier than the hero, as is the case here, and frequently he's in love with the hero's pretty wife, devoted to her in fact, which is not the case here. It's not one of Tracy's better parts, hobbled as he is by a script that turns him into a sullen and disapproving partner before he becomes a sacrificial lamb who turns Gable's life around.It's too talky. I enjoyed the scenes of flight, even the mock ups. I mean, how often do you get to see an experimental model of the B-17 on the screen? Or a Seversky P-35, a kind of forebear of the legendary P-47 Thunderbolt? The airplanes are real. On the other hand, you can usually tell when something dramatic is about to happen -- an engine fails, a stall takes place -- because suddenly we're watching obvious models.There's a scene at a drunken party after one of the test pilots goes all the way in. Myrna Loy happens to mention the dead pilot's name, Benson, and Gable is suddenly enraged and shouts at her, ""Who's Benson?"" We get a similar exchange, more light hearted, in Howard Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" a year or two later. (""Who's Joe?"") I'd like to think of it as a case of independent invention but Hawks was notorious for ripping stuff off from himself as well as others.",5,10,True
tt0030848,Marriage with a Daredevil,7.0,"A strange movie from 1938 that has a major white elephant sitting squarely in the middle of the plot that is impossible to ignore from a 2016 perspective.Clark Gable is the test pilot of the film's title, who falls hard for and marries farm girl Myrna Loy (Loy is about as convincing as a Wichita farm girl as I would be, but this is Myrna Loy we're talking about, so who cares?!!) Their courtship is treated as a screwball comedy, with Gable and Loy generating so much chemistry my television almost malfunctioned. But Loy struggles with the transition back to their everyday married life as she realizes the fear she feels every time Gable goes back to his job is something she has committed herself to for life.The white elephant in the room is the character of Gable's mechanic and buddy, played with a scowl by Spencer Tracy. I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not at least entertain the notion that Tracy's love for Gable is more than platonic. He seems to have no interest in women, or indeed in any life that does not include Gable. It's almost as if he and Loy have a tacit understanding that they're in love with the same man and agree to help each other through the trials and tribulations that come with that.Gable is Gable. Loy has never been better. She wasn't challenged often and was even usually underused in my opinion, but this is her movie and she ably demonstrates her range. Tracy is utterly wasted. Indeed, if the homosexual subtext isn't intentional, then there is literally no reason for him to be in the movie other than to be someone to whom Loy can deliver her lines when she's not delivering them to Gable.A mood of death and impending destruction overshadows the whole film. Whether or not this was an intentional reaction to world events at the time, it seems appropriate given the gathering shadow of world conflict that was growing in Europe.""Test Pilot"" received no Oscars but was nominated in three categories: Best Picture, Best Original Story (Frank Wead), and Best Film Editing (Tom Held).Grade: B+",5,8,False
tt0030848,Not a great Gable-Tracy film,6.0,"I wish I could be as enthusiastic about ""Test Pilot"" as some of the other people on this board. It has a great, tried and true cast - Gable, Tracy, Myrna Loy, and Lionel Barrymore. Good flying sequences, and very suspenseful scenes at the end.The first hour is lighter, and the dialogue is sharp - Gable is a flier who lands in the Kansas backyard of Loy. It's love at first sight, and they get married. Gable's best friend, Gunner, doesn't approve at first, but changes his mind later. Loy soon realizes that the life of a flier wife is one of worry and fear every time he goes up in a plane. But she loves him too much to leave.It's a very predictable film, and seen in today's world, darn strange that Gunner just hangs around Gable and then Gable and Loy all the time and has no other life.I usually try to watch movies in their world, in this case, 1938, but I found it difficult here. The acting is good - Gable and Tracy were a good team, Gable and Loy were a good team, and Lionel Barrymore gives a nice, underplayed performance. Tracy gives the strongest performance. The film became very melodramatic and the dialogue not as sharp as the first part of it. A case of too many cooks maybe. I just couldn't get into it.",4,8,False

The interaction is coy, innocent yet feisty, and lays a lot of groundwork for what 'buddy' comedy films still strive for.Paced fairly well, with just a dash of drama, the film hits on all cylinders and is definitely a popcorn movie.If you like this one, don't miss 'Boomtown' either.",5,8,False
tt0030848,star-studded tribute to '30s test pilots,5.0,"This is the second of 3 films featuring Gable and Tracy. The leading lady changed each time. This time, it was Myrna Loy as a flier-struck midwest farm girl who wins the heart of dashing Gable. The relationship between Tracy and Gable is basically the same in all 3 films. Tracy officially is the odd man out in a triangle. However, when Gable and the leading lady are feeling like enemies, Tracy takes over to console and advise the wife or girlfriend. In ""San Francisco"" and ""Boomtown"", they go back and forth as buddies or arch-enemies. In this film, they remain buddies, but Tracy and Myrna share the morose certainty that Gable will not live long in his role as test pilot for experimental aircraft. Gable, on the other hand, seems not to care whether he dies or is permanently maimed. Neither does he care sufficiently about the increasingly morose fears of Tracy and Marna to quit his dangerous job and stunt flying. Afterall, he periodically makes a bundle of cash(which he usually parties away)and becomes a local celebrity. Clearly, the '30s public liked films featuring both Gable and Tracy. But Tracy got fed up with playing second fiddle to Gable and ""Boomtown"" was their last pairing.It is usually assumed that Gable's character is based on the autobiography of test pilot Jimmy Collins, also titled ""Test Pilot"", published just a few years earlier. However, a detailed discussion at the Turner Classic Movies web site considerably muddies this neat assumption. Seems MGM already had this project in mind and named in 1933. Thus, MGM did not credit the story as being based on Collins' life or book. Yet, one of the most harrowing scenes in the film, when the wings are torn off Gable's plane in a high speed dive, essentially duplicates what happened in Collins' fatal crash, just a couple of years before. Incidentally, Collins' grandson, also named Jimmy, recently had his grandfather's book reprinted. He himself was one of the top rock climbers in the world a few decades ago. Seems that daredeviling runs in the family.Ironically, it was Tracy, not Gable, who eventually dies in a test run, apparently his only one.(Was this perhaps a confirmation of FDR's message ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself""?) However, the death of his friend and the resulting hysteria of Myrna finally convinces Gable that the highs he gets from constantly trying to cheat death are too great a price for those close to him. He retires to a ground instructor role. In retrospect, we wonder why Myrna's character agreed to marry Gable's character, knowing first hand how dangerous flying was at this time. Incidentally, in his fatal crash, Collins knew he was exceeding the design specifications of his aircraft. Setting a new record meant more to him than cheating death again. Appropriately, what was left of his plane nosedived into a cemetery(for test pilots?).Actually, this is my least favorite of the Gable-Tracy films, the others having more complicated plots. Dive bombing and crashing airplanes would become all too familiar in a few years. At this time, it was the test pilots of future warplanes who were the race car drivers of the sky. Hopefully, this film will be included in a future DVD Gable collection.",4,7,True

In this version we have Clark Gable, playing Jim a fun loving, joy seeking test pilot out to tame a plane and the sky-mistress. Spencer Tracy, plays Gunner he dutiful, loyal side kick who tries to play guardian angel over his reckless best friend. Myrna Loy is Ann a beautiful farm's daughter who becomes his girl and later his wife. With Lionel Barrymore playing Drake, his employer, the film dwells mostly on the personal relationship between the main characters and their ambitions. As such the movie is a soft but lofty tribute to foolhardy aviators and dwells painfully on the personal aspects between those who fly and those who expect the inevitable disastrous outcome of a failed aircraft. Though Tracy and Gable are a great team in other movies, they seem at odds in this one. Still, for an early war time propaganda film, it's acceptable, but hardly a classic for either star. ***",3,6,False

Of course, with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell that same chattering racket became the music of the spheres, so there is quite a range--I get that. But in 1938 a twenty-year-old man (like my father) could have sat in a dumpy theater in Riverside, California and pledged to be more like Clark Gable and live a life more like that of his (and a lot of other young men's) hero......and that would have been a mistake. Because this movie teaches you how to be a jerk.To me, as an old man in the year 2020, this movie is hopeless. Maybe Cary Grant and the other masters of the genre could make this kind of dialogue work, but Clark Gable just comes across as a guy you wish you could punch in the mouth.The flying scenes are few and far-between and Myrna Loy is just one more anomaly in a movie full of them. ""YOW! Who is THIS?"" You never get a reasonable answer. The aircraft are interesting, but mostly this movie is pure tedium. The biggest problem is that this is a film that pretends to be about ""reality"" but it pure nonsense, and, unfortunately, quite a few people in the audience in those days weren't hip to the joke.

Loy is an improbable farm girl and her conflict with the flamboyant Gable (in love with the wild blue dress yonder) is unconvincing compared to the witty interchanges with Powell in the Thinman films. Tracey, without a great part, shows how good he is. He just raises an eyebrow or lowers a lip -- no wonder Gable envied his acting! But watch this one as part of a ""history of flight"" course -- not necessarily how it was done back then but how it was depicted. And there is some truth to the mythology that inter-war flying in this country was done by a bunch of loners, rogues, and madmen.

But, the familiar problem rears its head: Myrna wants to domesticate him.Clark is the type of man who flies a dangerous airplane and takes chances because it gives him a thrill. If that's who she fell in love with, then she shouldn't want to change him. If she wants someone more sedentary, then she should have married Clark's pal, Spencer Tracy. This pseudo-love triangle is really irritating, since I'm not on anyone's side. I would have been far happier if everyone went their separate ways and made a much shorter movie.

Written by Frank Wead with the help of an uncredited Howard Hawks, a genius in his own right, the film must have been seen as a breakthrough for the way it presents all those daring men and the flying machines.The story brings centers in the relationship among Jim Lane, the ace pilot, Ann Barton, the Kansas girl he marries, and Gunner Morris, another pilot. The story does not make much sense because at first, Ann Barton looks she is a normal, well adjusted woman, who decides to throw away her quiet life in Kansas to follow Jim into an uncertain life having just met him. If that is not a stretch of the imagination, we do not know what is.The relationship between Jim and Gunner, the good friend, suffers because he is secretly in love with Ann; he realizes what the dashing Jim is doing to this lovely woman, but he stays out of the picture. His first loyalty is to him, not to Ann. Drinking affects Jim's life and eventually his own relationship with the woman that loved him, but he is lucky in having her stay with him.Mr. Fleming got good performances from the three principals, Clark Gable, the lovely Myrna Loy, and Spencer Tracy.

Which cast would you rather watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the cast in this original version is far better than his/her counterpart in the remake. The original cast delivers a film with risqué overtones (with a wink to the Hays Office), while Reynolds and (especially) Fisher turn the remake into 1950's milk and cookies.In Bachelor Mother a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is at her peak. She portrays a wonderfully sympathetic character. She is strong and feminine; exasperated yet determined. David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn - in top form here as the blustery, but good-hearted department store magnate who desperately wants a grandson.I like Debbie Reynolds fine, but Debbie doesn't deliver as nuanced a performance as Ginger Rogers. Eddie Fisher as an actor - No Way! The only time he is not completely painful to watch is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Adolphe Menjou is okay.I get angry at TCM for showing the remake more frequently than this delightful original. I get angrier still that some Hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of the story.For a terrific romantic comedy, accept no substitutes: check out Bachelor Mother.

But Niven does not disappoint... And it is a refreshing change from his Wuthering Heights type serious, pole stuck up his rear acting in other films.

tt0031067,Delightful little gem,,"I rarely write reviews but this was such a delightful gem of a romantic comedy that I had to support it.I cannot even explain why it was so great. It's a simple little movie, low-key, 100% predictable, with an absurd premise, and moves kind of slow, with no extravagant sets. The script is linear and the dialog is adequate but hardly a work of genius.Yet I enjoyed this more than any other film I've seen in a very long time. It was totally fun and, although there are much funnier comedies, ( Bringing Up Baby (1938), The In-Laws (1979), Simon (1980), Young Frankenstein (1974) come to mind), this one had me laughing out loud over and over, which I never do, because the comedy was so light hearted and due to the acting rather than the concept.The film has, as you know, a terrific cast. Ginger Rogers has everything. She is beautiful, she is intelligent, she can sing (no singing though in this film), dance (some nice dancing), be depressed or do comedy. I actually like the chemistry with David Niven better than with Fred Astaire, they make a terrific couple. Niven is funny as hell, and all the supporting cast chimes right in with perfect comic timing. As soon as Charles Coburn showed up on screen I was smiling. The film is full of tiny bits of physical comedy and small gags by actors with only a few seconds of screen time, who all perform like seasoned pros turning simple bits into remarkable, funny-bone tickling scenes.The comic acting is not stunning, as in the films I mentioned above; it is stylized, theatrical, a bit stiff. It's the style of the film which is not at all realistic, and somehow it works great. Rogers and Niven go through their comic facial expressions slowly and exaggeratedly, so everyone gets it, as if they were telling a story instead of acting it, and it adds to the effect of light heartedness.The portrayal of the romance, from the initial attraction, through the growing awareness of feelings, is nicely observant and free of cliché. Both the script and the performance capture some of the real moments that happen as two people are drawn together.The ending is, of course, a completely unbelievable high speed wind-up, fitting the conventions of the time, but I was wishing to follow the relationship along a more extended and realistic track. It would no longer have been a screwball comedy. And there is some absurd stop-motion animation of a mechanical duck where they don't even bother to move the feet properly. This is so blatantly faked that perhaps it is a signal from the director that he has been forced into a trite ending he disowns; or maybe just that the ending is forced by convention and not be taken seriously. It is as if it is Donald Duck who has dictated the final corny scene. It didn't bother me, though, because it is clear that the film would have had to end eventually like that even if it were worked out more believably.Also someone complained that the landlady should have known the truth about Rogers' character, not recalling that Rogers' had only been her tenant three weeks- short enough to make the plot work out. And I think it is just fine to call a baby it- plus it shows the awkward relationship the single, childless characters have with the baby that suddenly shows up in their life.If I had to say what it was that was so great about this film, other than seeing Ginger Rogers and David Niven, those two remarkable warm and generous personalities, playing off each other, it would be that the film seems to be filled with love and kindness. Released the year after Kristallnacht shocked the world, it features a saintly very Jewish landlady who comes to the rescue a number of times. There is a six month old baby, who does great work, and Rogers has some lovely scenes with the baby where she seems, briefly, to be genuine. Everyone wrongly thinks Rogers' character is an unwed mother, and there is not the slightest tinge of stigma associated with it throughout the film by any of the many characters that deal with her with kindness, love, acceptance and total respect (if not understanding), and there is also sympathy for the working class pain during the depression. The film totally avoids p retention, it wants to make us laugh and feel good, not to impress us, and it does.So I give this an 8, but really in terms of the heart it is priceless gem of a film, without a single wrong note, for anyone who loves screwball comedy and the great actors of yesteryear whose like, I am afraid, the business is not likely to produce again.",22,23,True

Especially when you've got David Niven as the playboy. Garson Kanin directed the Felix Jackson original story in the film that became Bachelor Mother. The original screenplay was nominated for an Oscar in that category, but lost to Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.I saw the musical remake that RKO did 17 years later with Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds and it was clear just how superior this film is to that one. Eddie was playing David Niven's part and while the man could sing, he hadn't a tenth of Niven's charm. To be perfectly fair though, there were few men as charming as David Niven, he carried more films on the strength of that charm than anyone else I can think of.Ginger Rogers was doing a great variety of dramatic roles now at RKO in between her films with Fred Astaire. She was really kicking her career into high gear at this point and would win an Oscar next year for Kitty Foyle. Hard as she struggles in this film to convince everyone she's not the mother it gets easier to just go with the flow.

Having a child, making a family, being a mother - these are the least natural, inevitable things in the world, and are a result of cynicism and chance.  The film's ambiguous title suggests that the character most in need of a mother is the bachelor, a sensational David Niven becoming, er, David Niven.

tt0031067,Ignore all the plot holes and just sit back and enjoy the fun!,8.0,"Okay, at the outset I've gotta admit that if you are the type person that CAN'T suspend disbelief and just keep your brain from thinking too much, you WON'T enjoy this film. But, if you can and are willing to see this film with an open mind, then you'll find it to be a delightful and funny little romance. Some of this is due to the clever dialog, some due to the fine direction and some of this is no doubt due to the excellent acting of the three leads in the film. And when it comes to the leads, you KNOW a film with Charles Coburn must be watching, as he plays his usual gruff but lovable old rich guy--and perhaps he's just a little more likable and cuddly in this film than usual.The plot is silly and easily could be explained away, but bear with it. Single lady Ginger Rogers is walking down the street when she sees an older lady placing a baby on the steps of a society for foundlings. However, the baby is precariously balanced and the lady just leaves the kid--and the kid might fall down the steps. So, nice lady Ginger picks up the tyke when the door opens and they assume the baby is hers. A quick visit with a doctor COULD have cleared this up but no one thought of that. Instead, after she leaves the baby (despite their protests), they decide to help this poor unfortunate lady by going to her boss and begging him to not only give her a job (she'd just been laid off) but to assist her take care of the little fella. This is how she meets young and handsome David Niven and again and again throughout the film, Niven and others insist the baby is Ginger's. Later, when Niven's father (Charles Coburn) finds out about this ""bachelor mother"", he is surprisingly delighted and thinks it's his son's! The film has a lot of laughs and is clever, but most of all, it's just a lot of fun as well as romantic.

From opening store-front scene to Polly's last ""Ha Ha"", it's completely hilarious. P.S. The film's continuity is pretty bad. If you watch the various cuts within the scenes, there are frequent mismatches. Two examples: A scene with Charles Coburn smoking a cigar shows him alternately with the cigar in his mouth or in his hand from cut to cut. The scene when the baby is found on the steps of the foundling home has a closeup which shows a door and blanket, and hand position which don't exist in the wider shot before and after the cut.

tt0031067,Modest Comedy Succeeds.,7.0,"You might expect something different from a synopsis. A baby is left on shop girl Ginger Rogers' doorstep. Everyone assumes she is the mother, including her wealthy boss, David Niven. Rogers and Niven are at odds with each other but shortly the inevitable happens. In addition to everyone's mistaken assumption that Rogers has had a (gulp) illegitimate child, there are various schemes to align her status as mother with her actual pristine character.I had plenty of handkerchiefs handy for when the plot slowed down for the drama and sentiment -- the cute little baby doing cute things, Rogers sobbing over her undeserved shame, everyone hugging the tot and weeping with love. Actually, I don't own any handkerchiefs, so I had paper towels at the ready. I didn't need them anyway. It's pretty funny.There are amusing incidents (a disguised Niven trying to exchange a faulty toy duck at the store he owns)and comic plot twists that end up with several men claiming to be the father.But it's a quiet comedy -- the screenplay is by Norman Krasna and the direction by Garsin Kanin -- no pratfalls and very little shrieking. It's done in a lower key than, say, the Doris Day/ Rock Hudson comedies but it travels on the same track. Instead of an obvious wise crack, we get someone muttering an ironic, ""Ha ha."" Ginger Rogers is really an attractive woman. She has oversized blue eyes and she can get an emotion across with a muted moue or a flick of her gaze. Niven is good, better at comic roles than dramatic. The supporting cast is at par, with Ferike Boros great as a stereotypical cheerful and loving grandmother, nurse, or housekeeper.If you get into it, you'll probably enjoy it.",11,11,True

David Niven is the rich shop-owner's son who both foists a child on Ginger that's not hers, and then falls in love with her and it, the adorable little ""Johnny"". And the always-great Charles Coburn is just marvellous as the ""grandfather"" who thinks that Niven and Rogers have produced his longed-for grandson.This is pretty much a perfect romantic comedy, with Rogers giving a terrific performance. Niven gets one of his more unusual roles, it;s sort of a role you imagine Cary Grant in, but he's delightful in it and has unexpectedly great chemistry with Ginger. Garson Kanin directs and Norman Krasna provides a sparkling comic script, that has you both laughing and getting a tear in the eye as a loving, makeshift family is created around a cute tot.

OK...BUT...didn't the landlady who saw her every day notice that she was NEVER pregnant? That she never went to the Hospital? That she never saw the baby during it's first few months? All of a sudden Ginger shows up with a 6 or 7 month old baby. Where was the baby supposed to be during those first months? Just doesn't make sense. And how convenient that the landlady is always available to take care of the baby, day and night!!! Aside from this major story line, BACHELOR MOTHER is still a fun sit through, although the ending is quite confusing.

I was drawn to the movie because of Bening - I enjoy her other films, but this one is a mockery of her talent!   The on-screen chemistry between her and Warren just isn't there.  The taboo of engaged couples ""cheating"" on one another is stale and the premise that Bening selflessly gets on with her life after her accident is implausible in today's world.  The chance that Beatty would have a little auntie (even if that auntie is Katherine Hepburn) living on a tropical island that just happens to be close to where the plane he was flying in makes an emergency landing,  is too much of a coincidence even for a fairy tale.  This movie is beyond real! The jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place.

tt0110391,"Painting, Shawls",,"There are multiple reasons to like this. I'll mention two.One comes from the fact that it is a remake. Such things have miraculous properties. Storytelling is all about choices, most invisible. Its the goal sometimes. But when you have a remake and you know the original, then all the scaffolding of the thing becomes visible and you can marvel or not at the changes that have been made. The choices.I do not know the 1939 version, but I do the 57 version with Cary Grant. Its not just mawkish and cheap, its offensive, even vile. The method of presentation depends not on the love, but on the helplessness of the pair. They are quite literally prostitutes, professional paid escorts. He is enchanted by her primarily because she didn't show at the rendezvous and since no one had ever turned him down before he fell in ""love"" hard, because of the chase. It hit all the negative buttons, even the racist ones.This redone in such a way that it avoids all those faults. It has almost precisely the same story, but instead of cheap sentimental exploitation, you get rich cinematic romance. You get love embodied in actors, three good ones. You get real love  at least so far as movies have  and not infatuation. You have lovers adjusting lives to fit, not tossing advantage in spite.For me it worked as a romantic movie. I know it failed to sell many tickets, and can only guess that it was too honest and true, with not enough sweeping violins. We don't like true love in movies.And that brings me to the other value, the fold with real life. Beatty really was the sort of character he played here, a serial screwer, a man engaged in the chase, someone not to be trusted but who clearly has an image-based artistic side. Benning's reputation was less public, but she was close to being the most desirable woman in Hollywood after ""Grifters."" They really did fall in love. At filming, she was already carrying their second child. The chemistry is real and conveyed effectively. I make a special study of films where the director is in love with the main actress. Its rare that such a man has such a love, and produces, writes and stars in such a profession of love. Life folded into film romance done competently and cinematically. Is there anything in film romance that matters more?The palette is rosey. Its lovely to watch.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",7,16,False

I'd not seen the Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr version (except for the little snippets that appear in ""Sleepless in Seattle""), so my opinion was not colored by the inevitable comparisons... It's just that the first half of the movie struck me as being incredibly *bad* : it was poorly written in particular. Once Katherine Hepburn appeared on the scene, the film began to improve quite noticeably, and the last half was considerably better, with superb performances, especially from the two principals. I've never been a big Warren Beatty fan, but Annette Bening is WONDERFUL!

But I've always considered Warren & Annette a perfect match...bland...bland...and more bland. Do they have a personality?? I truly don't understand how they got to where they are today, but I could say the very same thing about some of our re-electeds. If you want to watch a much better version of the story with an entirely different sphere of acting check out the 1957 version ""An Affair to Remember"" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Some scenes are a little outdated, but the acting and chemistry between these two make it timeless. They've made their characters seem so real, they almost jump out of the screen. Then it all comes to a head in this heartbreakingly emotional ending, a story of selfless love, I cry every time. Annette & Warren simply don't have the acting ability or charisma to give these characters that certain kind of trueness in which you would feel any great emotional investment.

The material is really only as good as the actors selling it, and Beatty and Bening are certainly a striking twosome. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have noticed that 37 years have passed since this tale had some merit, and the results are distinctly musty.

Okay, this movie was terrible.  People don't fall in love by having incredibly inciteful conversations on a plane upon their first meeting. Even Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr started with just some minor flirtations without completely psychoanalyzing each other.  (I'll make all my comparisons to ""An Affair to Remember"" since I haven't seen the original ""Love Affair"".)  This movie just tries too hard.  Characters, just like real people, can develop a deep relationship without saying deep things right off the bat.  Warren Beaty and Annette Bening's chemistry was zilch, especially when compaired to Kerr and Grant, who's chemistry was some of the best I've ever seen on film.  Even Katharine Hepburn, whom I adore, wasn't up to her usual standard.  She didn't come across as sweet and as inviting as the grandmother of ""An Affair to Remember"", and I know for a fact that she doesn't play the piano (see ""Song of Love"" for further proof), while her predicessor at least made an effort.  Nothing in the movie is as good as the original-I could rip apart every little moment if you want, but I do have something resembling a life.  I realize that ""Remember"" was a remake itself, but I don't think I would have liked this movie even if I hadn't fallen in love with ""Remember"".  These two characters don't ever seem to fall for anything more than the pseudo-deep conversation on the plane and physical attraction, whereas Kerr and Grant talk about their lives and interests. How many times throughout their film does one say ""What were you saying?"" when the other said nothing, and the first one then proceeds to say exactly what they were thinking?  Quite a few, for those not fortunate enough to have seen it yet.  That's a connection, not Beatty gazing drunkenly at Benning across the table.  As for the music everyone raves about, ""Remember"" had a beautiful theme song, complete with vocals, that was weaved throughout the film.

The Indian cinema has done a version of it a few years after this film came out.

Warren Beatty and Annette Bening fill the shoes of previous lovers Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne and Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. With very few deviations except those to update the story this film has the same plot.One of those deviations has our star crossed lovers Warren Beatty and Annette Bening meeting on a transoceanic flight to Sydney, Australia which is certainly a lot of time to get acquainted. They get even better acquainted when they are forced to land on a Pacific island where Beatty's grandmother Katharine Hepburn has a nice tropical place. The kind of setting where romance has to bloom.This was Katharine Hepburn's last big screen appearance, she did one more television film and then her Parkinson's Disease and other ailments that beset people of the age she lived to forced her retirement. I'll bet she never thought she would in 1939 wind up in a remake of a film doing a part Maria Ouspenskaya created. She does it grand style though and only Kate can make an old Anglo-Saxon expletive sound elegant.That Warren Beatty got nominated for a Razzie award for remaking Love Affair is a disgrace. This is old fashioned romantic entertainment, the kind that old Hollywood used to do.

After that, they make a pact to meet at the Empire State Building after a few months and...well, if you've seen the other two (which I haven't) you know what happens. I wasn't sure what to think of this movie with many of the quick-cutting of some scenes and many of the somewhat benign nature of some of the dialogue at the beginning but by the time of Hepburn's appearance, I was charmed by the way Beatty and, especially, Bening interacted with the veteran 4-time Oscar winner especially with the way Ms. Hepburn used a certain word in asking about ducks. Also with her appearance as well as a later one with Ray Charles singing ""The Christmas Song"", I wondered about what great losses we've had the last five or so years. Many of the supporting cast like Garry Shandling and Harold Ramis (neither of whom I thought had any funny scenes) I recognized but I didn't realize Wendie Jo Sperber and Lisa Edelstein were here until I read the end credits. I did like also some of the musical selections like the ""M'm! M'm! Good!"" spot with Ed McMahon, the children's chorus of The Beatles' ""I Will"", and that duet with Louis Jordan and Louis Armstrong on ""Life Is So Peculiar"" that scored some of the cruise scenes.

tt0110391,Quite impressive,7.0,"As a big devotee of the original 'Love Affair' I recorded this one mainly out of morbid curiosity, with the intention of pulling it to pieces once I was done. I have *never* seen a good remake of a classic film (Sweet November anyone? *throws up*) but I must say, grudgingly, this one was good. Not great, not a patch on the original, but good nontheless, and worth seeing at least once. Possibly the best thing is that in remaking it, they simply re-cast the film, changed only a few minor details, managed to keep all of the good scenes intact, and did not need to throw in a lot of sex. For a change. And so, that rates it a few more points from me, because there's honestly nothing worse than remaking a classic and throwing in lots of sex, when the original did perfectly fine without it. This 'Love Affair' was in that respect definitely more mature than many recent films. It's a simple delight for everyone of all ages and in another fifty years I wouldn't mind calling this one a classic. Well, that might be pushing it a little.Katharine Hepburn was brilliant as always and although I've never seen Beatty or Bening before in any films, I can't find anything wrong in their casting (thank god it wasn't Adam Sandler or Keanu!). Beatty is of course no Boyer or Cary Grant but he handled the closing scene superbly, and I must say if anything of Bening's ever pops up on tv again, I might give it a look. She has to be a pretty good actress for me to stop glaring at her because she's not Irene Dunne! And I liked the scene where she was singing the Beatles' song as well, there should have been a full performance of that.I'd give this a 7/10, because I can't help but compare it to the original.

tt0110391,A scene which is worth a whole film,,"Whenever I want to watch a film in which Warren Beatty's name appears,I know that there must be a damn good reason that has made him contribute to this film.He doesn't have that many films,and there is hardly a film of his that doesn't have a strong statement to make.When I sat down to watch ""Love Affair"",I didn't know that it was a re-make of the 1939's ""Love Affair"" and 1957's ""An Affair to Remember"".I was so marveled with the boyish charm of Warren Beatty when he was trying to hook up the main female character of the film,his real life wife,Annette Bening as Terry McKay,and it was after Mike(Warren's character)and Terry's visit to his aunt,superbly portrayed by Katharine Hepburn,that I noticed the similarities.By the sheer appearance of Hepburn as Mike's aunt on the scene,even before she had noticed the arrival of her nephew,when she was chatting with the docks,she established her presence so rapidly and strongly that made me forget about the other characters.However strong was Hepburn's performance,how much it overshadowed the performance of Beatty and Bening,it was justified.One could sense their admiration towards her, not only as the characters of the film,but as co-workers as well.And that's exactly what gives truthfulness to the point of documentary,to this scene.When Beatty was listening and watching the two women perform the song ,it was obvious that it was not just Mike looking at his aunt,but also Warren Beatty,stoned in awe of the sensitivity and artistry of a Legend.The same goes for Annette Benning.In her conversations with the aunt, and while she was accompanying her by humming,while she was playing the piano,it was again Annette Bening dazzled by her aura.At that point, both us,the viewers,and Beatty and Bening became one,we all were viewers.They were all swans,both the couple dressed in white and in total peace and harmony with themselves and the nature,and the old and wise aunt,Katharine Hepburn,making her unforgettable performance as her swan song.If there is a reason for this film to exist, is that scene.The scenes following their arrival in New York do not have the saying and drive of the first half of the film.Even the scene with Ray Charles which is the living proof of the victory of love and dedication over any misfortune,is not able to prevent the spectator from feeling sorry for the lovers,instead of celebrating their re-union.The scene with the aunt was so honest, so profound,that I was expecting something new,something breathtaking as that scene itself.And I kept telling to myself that this is a Warren Beatty film,it is eventually going to take another turn, unravel another aspect of the story,it isn't going to end like that.But to my surprise it did.The ""Love Affair"" which began in the sky ended on a not strong enough land.But it made us the witnesses of one of cinema's most cherishable moments,the getting together of the guru and her apostles.",3,7,True

The current drama/romance genre is something I am not often fond of, yet this film had a resonance, especially for the holiday season.No, it is not the same as the Deborah Kerr, Cary Grant version, but that is a bit dated. There is a cameo scene with Katharine Hepburn, she as Beatty's great- aunt, he as someone at a crossroads in his life; wondering if there will be a turning point. Bening is a singer/actress, they agree to meet in NY, a year after if neither is attached to their current significant other. Beatty and Bening actually make a nice couple, for me to have enjoyed this film at Christmas, points to the fact that it is not another romantic comedy we can toss out ( a rare thing) probably because Beatty and Bening have a believable chemistry together.The final scene, sad as it is Christmas, and the children singing a version of the Beatles' ""I will"" is atmospheric.

tt0031679,A National Treasure,10.0,"James Stewart and Frank Capra.  One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

tt0031679,"It works in a way no other movie could, THERE IS PROOF",10.0,"Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films. There is a warmth, idealism, and kinda simple feeling of hope, that makes one believe that things will work out in the end. Capra knew exactly what he wanted, and it shines. Jimmy Stewart, in the role of his life, makes us believe, what we know is almost impossible in todays crass world.Claude Rains is incredible as Senator Smith's evil mentor. Jean Arthur, as his confidant, plays the part so well,that we just want her to save the day.The final scene, where the filibuster is taking place, is among the greatest ever made.BUT THE PROOF, YOU ASK?In the early 80s, I showed this film, over three days, to a group of 15 year old inner city teenagers. I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago. It was a new class, and not all of the ""best"" students took it.I decided to show this film at the end of the year, just to see how long I could keep the students attention. I didn't expect much. Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span, and it was at the end of the day, 2:30 -3:15 pm. which made things worse. As the film began, there was rustling in the seats, boredom, that famous oh what a waste of time look...Mind you, this is 43 year old film, about a white Senator, in those ""old"" days, and being shown to a totally Afro-American crowd of 15 year olds, late in the day, (over a three day period, which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on. ..By the end of the third day, Capra had worked his magic, and the entire class was spellbound by this film. They were there till the very end, and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film, that they wouldn't have looked at in a thousand years..Comments were wonderful. Any film that could accomplish this, more than 40 years after its conception, to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in, deserves to be truly called a ""great film.""",159,188,False
tt0031679,Required viewing for anyone elected or appointed for public office.,10.0,"Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based).  There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term ""Capra-esque"" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message.  His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic.  And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.A Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor.  They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate.  After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process.  After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC.  Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders.  Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.Although the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt.  The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self.  A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief.  The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact.  There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score.  The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.Obviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was.  The movie showed an ideal, a supposed ""lost cause"" of truth in government.  And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards.  If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches.  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.  And in giving this rating, either I'm damn right or I'm crazy.",111,131,False
tt0031679,Want to Get Your View Across? Why Not Filibuster?,,"The media and those in Washington, D.C. cringed in 1939 when Frank Capra (Oscar-nominated for directing) come out with ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Capra, fresh off amazing successes like ""Lady for a Day"", ""It Happened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""Lost Horizon"" and ""You Can't Take It With You"", used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience. As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he won't rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of the Boy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided by many high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys' camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (a never-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) are all terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5.",72,86,False

While the governor is sitting down to dinner, his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children.

Sometimes I'm disappointed when a universally acclaimed movie isn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. But here, that is not the case. James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role. That's saying a lot given his impressive body of work. This is also Frank Capra's signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but, and I know this is a cliché, the world could use more people with his values. The supporting cast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr. Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",35,47,False
tt0031679,Capra-corn but very watchable with some great performances...,,"Frank Capra's knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances. Ironically, Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.;As a bumbling, naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington, D.C., Stewart does a fabulous job--although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he's the real thing.All of the supporting players are excellent--especially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him, and Harry Carey (the western actor) as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots, grinning and sometimes stifling a grin, say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.But, as usual in a Capra film, you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending (when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time) is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he'd gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality (such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she'd find him), is hard to swallow until you remind yourself that--hey, this is Capra-corn. Nevertheless, despite some flaws, it's the kind of comedy-drama about Washington, D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed, as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior, filibustering, etc. It will leave you with a warm glow--somewhat like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in that respect.Summing up: It's Stewart's show all the way. He's at his peak here.",32,45,False

And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy ""works""). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. ""Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!"" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young, new-in-town senator. It's also a witty, more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically, the core of the story is the fish-out-of-water type, where Stewart's Jefferson Smith (one of his better Hollywood performances), leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator (Claude Rains, terrific as always). And there's even a woman (Jean Arthur) in the mix that's growing an interest in him, at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold, as skilled a character actor as could be asked for), Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster, which includes a reading from the Constitution, in-and-out cheers from the Boy Rangers, and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words, it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in, and even at its cheesiest and sometimes most-dated moments, it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equal-opportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical, and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.",35,44,False

Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known, but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy, so be it, but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil. Stewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not ""the best candidate"" for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that, , but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator, you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife, no girl friend; he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others, is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.Somehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all. And discovers love and gets the girl in the end. If you like vintage syrup, this movie is right for you. Just remember, its just a movie, and in real life, the bad guys usually win.",18,32,True
tt0031679,I was not impressed,1.0,First of all my problem with this movie may be I am not an American. It may be it won a lot of Oscars. But the movie have been made before just better by the same director.Story: Same story as Mr. Deeds goes to town. Just removed of the parts where you get to like the protagonist. Seriously Smith arrives to Washington and disappears for 5 hours without anyone knowing where he is. Then you do not think he is a guy from the countryside like Deeds was but just a plain idiot. Then the conflict arrives. They have planned the same land for a Dam and a boy scout camp. The camp could have been moved easily without anyones protest the rich backer could even have bought some other land for him and be standing as the hero. This just destroyed the premise of the movie that the conflict is based on nothing plausible.Actors: Jean Arthur was lovely and played very well. Jimmy Stewart had better been replaced by Gary Cooper as in Deeds. Stewart of course did not have a lot to work with in this movie.Conclusion: It may have made a large impact when it was made. But not in any way subtle about anything. You pretty fast get hammered into your head how good Smith is and how corrupt the rest of the politicians are. Funny thing is the movie ignores politics completely. Had they wanted to show how it works then they had just found a solution about moving the camp. A bogus conflict flush out all the corruption. There are loads of better movies and less preachy about corruption. See Mr. Deeds go to town instead as that is a real gem even though topic is not politics.,15,29,False

tt0031679,Pet projects,4.0,"Director Frank Capra is maybe the greatest patriot in American film. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington shows plainly that he cares about national values and that he wants to help consolidate the communitarian spirit.For Frank Capra parliamentary democracy, enacted in a monument-studded capital, is a cornerstone of the structure of American values. For him it is, as this movie plainly shows, a matter of the heart. In my opinion, that is bad. Parliamentary democracy spells COMPROMISE. It is a matter of reason. Or else it would not work. That's what is wrong with this movie, it muddles the issue in a dangerous way.The protagonists are a young inexperienced Senator (James Stewart) and the big meddler and, so to speak, unofficial King of the Senator's state (Edward Arnold). The King has a pet project, a dam which - if I got that right - he wants to have financed by the Federal Government and from which he will eventually earn a huge profit. If others, not least the population of the concerned state, will also profit in one way or the other from the dam, does not interest anybody. Least the Senator. Because he has his own pet project, a camp for Boy Scouts which he envisions - what a coincidence! - on the very spot on which the aforementioned dam is planned. No wonder he is dead set against it.So, is it all about that goddamn dam? I'm afraid it is. For the sake of the two pet projects the legislative process of a whole nation is brought to a complete standstill while the Senator is filibustering - apparently the greatest achievement of American parliamentary democracy. Not the best propaganda for the system, if you think about it. It is hard not to see this as the Senator's selfish fight for an isolated issue, with an absolute disregard for the general whole. That his fight leads to a veritable and truly uncanny children's crusade"" is frightening, not rousing.I know, I am probably too harsh on this movie. After all, it is only a movie, and its intentions are unquestionably good. James Stewart is at his stumbling cutest, and Jean Arthur, a truly wonderful actress who holds a special place in my heart, is at moments beautiful beyond belief.

They can, for example, appreciate the costuming or the musical score, even if the story is boring or the characters uninteresting. I'm not like that. Maybe that means I lack culture. But I appreciate a well-paced intelligent drama such as Wag the Dog.So when it comes to viewing the classics, sometimes I like 'em and sometimes I don't. Art critics don't seem to be able to tell the difference. Unfortunately, I did not find Mr. Smith Goes to Washington accessible. The story is syrupy, melodramatic, and with too much patriotic fervor. It's sort of a courtroom drama, but instead of fighting over facts and witnesses there's a lot of speechmaking about morals. The ending was as contrived as the one in Legally Blonde. Sure, it's inspiring to see someone fight for truth. But can we have some plot? Some characters with depth?Who should see this film:-- Arty types who appreciate the classics-- Regular folks like me who sample the classics hesitantly, there are better picks. And avoid It's A Wonderful Life, too.I believe in rating a film based on how it plays out today, not when it was originally made.

tt0031679,Political Story With Some Good Messages,8.0,"When I started seriously collecting films in the mid '90s and discovered classic movies, this was one of the first famous classic films I watched. I found it a good movie, a very powerful one, but yet one I have not watched again, for some reason. I guess it wasn't that attractive to me to see multiple times.Yet, I can't criticize it. Jimmy Stewart is interesting as always, in the lead as ""Jefferson Smith."" Jean Arthur is the most fun of all the actors to watch in here and actually her ""Clarissa Saunders"" might be the lead character, not Stewart's. Claude Rains is so good that you want to punch his character, ""Sen. Joseph Paine"" right in the nose!I will say it's very dated, but some of that corny stuff adds to the enjoyment of the story. Some of it is refreshing, too, like the unashamed overt promotion of solid values, for instance - something Liberal viewers watching this must hate.

tt0031679,Modern politics have taken it's dream from it but it is still a good film,,"With the passing of his stooge senator, Senator Paine and his businessman bosses need a new patsy to help get a bill through congress.  When their party man is rejected they select the all-American Jefferson Smith, reasoning that he will be too overawed and just do what he is told.  At first Smith does just that, but then his plans to build a boy's camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress, makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylor's business.  A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level, Smith takes action, but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being anti-American in it's depiction of congressmen as anything except honest, God fearing men of the people.  Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as `in bed with business' or `remote from the people' makes it look like a fantasy.  But it is a fantasy  an ode to the American Dream.  Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress, holds to it's ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is `un-American'. As a story it works well in a sappy type of way.  For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory.  The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified, and the final 20-odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping for.Stewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work.  Jean Arthur is good as the `tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm' and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells.  Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote.  The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder  good, but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rights.Overall this is a good film.  Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way.  It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples.  Where `it's a wonderful life' was uplifting because it was about human nature, this didn't have the same impact because I don't believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway (watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie).  Still a good movie though.",11,21,False
tt0031679,Mr. Smith learns about politics the hard way,10.0,"What a wonderful film. What an exaggerated, corny, fantastic, beautifully acted, exciting, wonderful film.""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a classic for good reason. It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way: idealism, strong, unshakable belief, never quitting, honesty, and commitment. Today, patriotism and ""American values"" have taken on another connotation. They have become the property of the right wing. But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith, which are different from what is being expressed today.Is anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money, I sadly have to answer that I don't think so. In the real world, as Court TV has taught us, things don't work that way. Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly, I'd have to say probably. Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they? Definitely.""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is a fantasy, but it's a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and, like Jean Arthur says in the film, maybe being jaded isn't such a good idea all the time.James Stewart had the role of a lifetime, and he was perfect. Homespun, intelligent, boyishly good-looking, his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves. His filibuster scenes are incredible, passionate, and strong. We were lucky we had him as long as we did. There will never be another. Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in. Claude Rains, as the unlikable, weak Senator Paine, gives a powerful performance. The bad guys - and Capra always makes sure they're real bad - were all great. As for Harry Carey, the sympathetic speaker, you want to hug him. A fantastic job.Frank Capra knew how to make movies. The pace is swift, the story strong, and the scenes tense and exciting.

tt0031679,"Sure It's Cheesy, But Also Oh So Aspirational",9.0,"Critics of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques ""wrong"". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.For a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to ""tow the party line"".This movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't ""politics as it is"", but rather ""politics as we want it to be"", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.Of course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, ""golly gee whiz"" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in ""12 Angry Men"". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.The only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.Overall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature.",16,18,False
tt0031679,Pure as the driven ho.,5.0,"Politicians are whores. This we know to be fact.So what makes anyone think the idealistic Mr. Smith in MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON would not buckle at the knees and subscribe to the corruption inherent in the system, were his career drawn out long enough? Alan Grayson, the real life Democratic Florida senator in the 2009 Health Care Reform battle, is being called Mr. Smith. He swoops into a fray where his own party has exhibited such gutlessness, that by simply by telling the truth, he is being called an ""idealist."" Director Frank Capra's MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is a paean to idealists. If it weren't for Mr. Grayson illustrating that idealists still skulk the dread halls of Congress, MR SMITH would look like pure fantasy...No sex, no violence, no swearing, we wonder whether this is a tale involving congress at all. Then we see how a spineless governor is forced into appointing a junior senator to be a puppet of the Senate and we see that politics back in 1939 (before they invented sex, violence and swearing) worked a lot like it does these days.When we see how the spineless governor appoints the junior senator - through a coin toss - we realize it's *exactly* how politics works these days.James Stewart is Jefferson Smith, the young, naive senator. When Smith arrives in Washington D.C., it's Idealism City, as he goes tramping through a montage, visiting the landmarks: the Liberty Bell, the Capitol Building, the Constitution, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial with its inspiring words carved into a wall, that mean absolutely nothing to modern politicians. Patriotic themes, American flags superimposed flying proudly over the montage...Smith's reaction is that of a mildly retarded yokel, and when he is skewered in the newspapers for his naivete, he goes around punching out all the offending reporters. Frank Capra may be a renowned director, but how childish is this cringe-tastic scene? Not one of the reporters who smeared Smith thinks to further smear him for his lunatic reaction of spending all day hunting them out in pubs and punching them.Idealistic Smith meets his secretary, the smug Saunders (Jean Arthur), who educates him in the cynical ways of Washington. This is probably the only film where discussing how a bill goes through congress is foreplay. After Saunders describes the near impossibility of shepherding a bill through congress (like then, as now), Smith is idealistic/stupid enough to reply, ""Shall we start writing it now or after dinner?"" His cause becomes lobbying for funding for a Boy's Camp - unlike today, the politicians who lobbied for underage boys back then were never caught with their hands down those boys' pants.Saunders does dissuade Smith for a moment - until he gives her Obama Speech Number 21 (that inspiring one) and she goes into soft focus so much the filmstock nearly deteriorated, until they started working on that sexy bill, bodies writhing in sensual penmanship.Of course, bills do get passed in Congress - for idealistic reasons or otherwise (usually otherwise) - but Smith annoyingly insists on being so Luke Skywalker about it. Which is understandable, as Smith's character is an much a fantasy as Skywalker's. (But there's that Alan Grayson thing...) Smith discovers his hero and mentor, Senator Paine, is part of the corrupt system that he rails against, and is so crushed he goes into idealism overdrive for his Boys Camp funding. Until Paine double-crosses him and Swiftboats him before Swiftboating was invented.When Smith sees 50,000 letters protesting him, his overacting goes into orbit to combat the corruption. To combat Smith's overacting, Paine steps up his own overacting, storming into Congress and shouting a confession at the top of his voice on the ""rotten political corruption of the state."" You have more chance of destroying a Death Star by firing into a vent no bigger than a womp rat than of hearing an American congressman calling himself and the system corrupt.MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is lauded as one of the great American films. But it is embarrassing idealistic idiocy. Without any solutions. It relies on the age-old tactic of being a drama queen to get through the armor of corrupt politicians. But real world politicians do not ignore laypeople because they are too busy or too corrupt or even because they hold laypeople beneath their contempt. Laypeople appeal to ideals and morals and ethics that politicians had to shunt aside to get to their positions in the first place. You appeal to qualities and virtues that are not in the politician's vocabulary any more. They are bereft of those ideals laypeople appeal to. THAT is why they do not listen to you - you are speaking antelope, and they are speaking lion.Let me tell you one more thing about Alan Grayson: They're calling him ""Mr. Smith"" - as an insult. That should tell you everything you need to know about what Washington thinks of this film.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",11,18,True
tt0031725,NINOTCHKA Still Defies Her Critics,,"An expertly-played and presented comedy that continues to be dogged by detractors for the oddest reasons. Some feel NINOTCHKA suffers compared to Lubitsch's earlier work, finding it formulaic alongside 1933's TROUBLE IN PARADISE. (I hadn't known Lubitsch had been given 'do-what-thou-wilt' privileges from the Hays Office - I'd labored under the delusion he faced the same restrictions in content and tone every other moviemaker did in 1939.) Other nay-sayers decry the film's jabs at Soviet collectivism as 'dated' if not 'unenlightened'. (Huh? You mean show trials and forced starvation of kulaks were GOOD things that a truly witty screenplay would celebrate?) Still other kibitzers squawk over the casting, of all things! (While it IS fun to picture William Powell or Robert Montgomery in the role of Leon, the boulevardier, Melvyn Douglas was never better than he is here. If he has his spotty moments, it's in those scenes where he must swoon with ardor, reciting dialogue that rings a tad purple to the ear; it's quite possible Powell or Montgomery would have fared even worse reading those lines.) Okay, enough defense - now let's go to NINOTCHKA's numerous strengths. Garbo is magnificent; she has a real knack for comedy (her deadpan entrance is hilarious) yet, as always, is able to break your heart with a look, a word, a gesture. Her three 'stooges' (Sig Rumann, Alexander Granach & Felix Bressart) are broadly funny and genuinely endearing. Ina Claire is everything her legend always claimed she was - though her character is icily calculating, you can't hate any woman who can make dialogue bristle like this. Lubitsch is in complete command throughout; his staging and pacing of the proceedings, masterful in its seeming effortlessness. Even the storied Metro glitz shines in NINOTCHKA, right down to the brilliant artifice of Cedric Gibbons' art direction (the Eiffel Tower sets especially). Last but not least is the superb screenplay by (among other hands) the team of Charles Brackett & Billy Wilder. Wisely, their satiric darts are dipped in a curare leavened by wit and sentiment, and while they are thrown with accuracy, their sting is never such that the satire sinks into the mire of political ideology. NINOTCHKA, after all, is about the triumph of love over politics, and to those who feel trapped in the prevailing toilet-ethic of the Farrelly Brothers' blood-poisoning of modern comedy, represents a much-needed antidote. Inoculate yourself at your earliest opportunity.",93,115,False
tt0031725,Garbo laughs... and for very good reason!,8.0,"NINOTCHKA tells the story of a female special envoy from Russia (Greta Garbo), sent to Paris to investigate the rather unorthodox and generally inefficient way in which three Russian ambassadors (Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski--the trio serve as an excuse for much slapstick hilarity in the film) are carrying out their job. They're supposed to be selling jewels belonging to the former Grand Duchess, Swana (Ina Claire), but instead get distracted by the luxuries of capitalist society as gleefully pressed onto them by the Count d'Algout, Leon (Melvyn Douglas). It doesn't take long for the dour, humourless Ninotchka to fall hard for the charming Leon, and their love story begins atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris. We gather, however, that Leon and the ex-Duchess share a casual on-off relationship and Swana handily uses Nina's deep love for her mother Russia to blackmail the latter into returning to Russia without a word to Leon. So what happens when the Russian customs official refuses to give Leon a visa into Russia? You'll have to watch for yourself to discover the whimsical, delightful ending.All in all, NINOTCHKA is a fine, funny film, with romance spilling out of its seams. From the first dry, crisp conversation between Leon and his Ninotchka while they wait for a whistle-break in Parisian traffic, you become involved with the characters and their love as he tries to break down her icy defenses, as he keeps trying in the face of her many rebuffs. One standout scene would be that of the drunken interlude in Nina's Royal Suite, as the couple look quizzically at the necklace that would bring them together and separate them, and Leon crowns his girlfriend before laying her gently on the bed, kissing her goodnight and taking his gentlemanly leave. It's also hard to beat the scene in which, as the tagline proudly declares, 'Garbo Laughs!', as Leon tries to coax a laugh out of Nina, and only succeeds by falling over backwards in his chair. The romantic comedy is certainly strong and sweet, but there's plenty of other comedy available as well, largely thanks to the three Russian sidekick ambassadors charmed by the benefits of capitalism. It's great fun watching them flounder helplessly when they first meet their stern, unforgiving Comrade Yakushova, but warm up to her when they return to Russia and have an omelette dinner together.There is no doubt that Greta Garbo turns in a great performance as the title character. She plays the ice queen very convincingly, with the appropriate suggestion that her lips haven't seen a smile in a decade or so. (If you're worried, her Russian accent is also perfectly credible, though at times she lapses into something somewhat less than Russian.) When she finally breaks into laughter, the transition is believable, as is the sunny change that thereafter infuses Nina as she becomes Leon's Ninotchka. It's an especially nice touch to have her unable to suppress a wave of laughter in the first official meeting--it's also hilarious when she suddenly generously gives her three colleagues fifty francs because they're out of money... only to qualify that by asking them to bring her back 45 francs! I think it is to Garbo's credit that she can pull off both the dour, passionless Comrade Yakushova and the almost shy, giggling Ninotchka with equal aplomb. (Her frequent question, ""Can I make a speech?"", when drunk on champagne is--I think the only word for it is--adorable.) That face of hers, so famous around the world, really *is* made for the cameras, and I think Lubitsch captured it beautifully. (Lubitsch also directs with the lightest of touches, allowing his cast full rein.) Melvyn Douglas looks absolutely no different from his role a decade later in MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, but there is no doubting that this is Garbo's film.This is a sweet, happy film about love overcoming ideology, nationality, and geography, and one that doesn't feel the need to beat us over the head with it. The relationship is well-developed, the characters interesting, and the execution top-notch. For me personally, the film lacks something that would render it a 10/10 classic, but that certainly isn't indicative of its quality as a romantic comedy.

In 1939 the Soviet Union had sympathizers in the US, and during the coming World War it was an ally. This gentle spoof of Soviet seriousness and self-conscious worker ethics foreshadows the arguments that were later trotted out after the War to begin the Cold War, but here the humor and satire are soft, more Noel Coward than propaganda.My lament is not seeing more comedy from Garbo.

Its premise, a Soviet comrade who falls for a dilettante in pre-War Paris, has potential.  But the 1930s requirement for evening dress scenes, a bedroom scene or two, always with lavish studio sets, suddenly makes the plotline seem foolish.  When the third act moves to a communal apartment in Moscow, the movie becomes ludicrous.Garbo is both sultry and radiant and when the camera moves in for a closeup, she glows under the special lens. And true, you get to see Garbo laugh. But since I never bought into the love affair between Garbo and Douglas, I found the remainder of the film concocted.  The ending is atrocious and unsatisfying.There is no one to blame for this. This is a period movie that hasn't survived the period. Ironically, there is a good Russian film 'Sluzhebnyj roman' which deals with similar characters: a strait-laced, hard, professional woman who meets a man and opens up to love.  No doubt the theme is universal.  It's just that ""Ninotchka"" misses the execution, at least to modern eyes.",17,47,False

They have been sent to sell the confiscated jewels of a Russian countess, played haughtily by Ina Claire. She refuses to let them go without a fight, and enlists the help of her attorney and playboy (Melvyn Douglas) to win them back. Unfortunately for her, he falls under the charms of Ninotchka, as do we.I have never been a fan of Garbo or the moody brooding she was always asked to do in her films. Lubitsch completely understood the image she had in the public's collective mind, and so for the first half of this movie, Garbo presents a parody of herself, refusing to crack a smile despite Douglas's herculean efforts to make her. But then Ninotchka gradually begins to fall under the spell of Paris, its good food and fashionable hats, a pratfall involving Douglas is finally enough to make her laugh, and from that moment on, she's a delight. For an example of just how good a comedienne Garbo could be, watch Ninotchka's face as Douglas's character tells her corny joke after corny joke in an attempt to win a smile from her; or the scene set in a nightclub when Ninotchka discovers the capitalist wonders of champagne.Grade: A+",32,38,False

The former owner of the jewels, Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), is exiled in Paris, and try to retrieve the possession through the French justice. Her lawyer and lover, Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), advises the Russians to wait for the sentence of the justice. Meanwhile, the Russian supervisor Nina Ivanovna Yakushova ""Ninotchka"" (Greta Garbo)"" is sent to Paris to survey and evaluate the performance of the negotiators, and incidentally meets Count Leon d'Algout. They feel initially attracted for each other, and later they fall in love for each other. However, the Grand Suchess becomes jealous and their love become impossible due to the Russian closed political system. ""Ninotchka"" is a delightful romantic comedy and funny satire to the fight of classes. The chemistry between Melvyn Douglas, who has a magnificent performance, and Greta Garbo, gorgeous as usual, is amazing. The confrontation between the capitalism and socialism systems is exaggerated, labeled and caricatured, but very funny, provoking many laughs.

tt0031725,Becomes Unwatchable,4.0,"Here Garbo plays a Soviet official sent to Paris to oversee three Marx Brother type Soviet loons who have bungled their attempts to sell a priceless bit of jewellery which, it turns out, belonged to an exiled Russian royal now in Paris, who wants them back.Garbo speaks Russian in a dour, atonal voice tapering down at the end, like Lotte Lenya's Klebb in From Russia With Love. She has the hooded eyelids and joyless expression of Macca's Linda when made to shake the tambourine to Mul of Kyntyre in Wings.All the Parisians are American actors. The one who woos Garbo's inscrutable Red is Melvyn Douglas, unrecognisable from his later role as Paul Newman's father in Hud.Sadly Douglas sank the film for me. It starts off very well, it's Top Hat territory really: mistaken identity, a suspicious hotel concierge, art deco apartments: all shiny surfaces and those big pannelled doors that slide open and shut. But Douglas is too sexless to be a leading man; you need a roguish charmer like Fred Astaire and once I realised how perfect he would have been in the role, I grew to loathe Douglas who put me in mind of the actor who played Watson opposite Rathbone in the Sherlock Holmes films, or even the headmaster in Ferris Bueller -certainly not leading man material. You want the woman to submit in a battle of sexes comedy because she'll be on to a winner, but here I found myself hoping she'd hold out against him. Why not ask Maurice Chevalier to do the role? I guess they needed an American lead.Also, the credit crunch and the UK's current drift to bankruptcy makes this not such an amusing watch: when Garbo's dour Russian shakes her head and says: ""Any culture that allows women to wear such a silly hat cannot be long for this world!"", or words to that effect, it's an uncomfortable moment. Because it really is a silly hat... Later, Garbo is seen wearing it once she 'sees the light' regarding Western capitalist ways. It's like having an Iranian woman deciding that Heat magazine is actually a jolly good read on her visit to the UK...When Douglas is off screen, I enjoy the film, but otherwise I had to skip to the end. He talks to Garbo like he's a father indulging a daughter, really quite irritating. Garbo is very good, though her thawing is a bit quick when it happens.",13,32,False

The dialog from Melvin Douglas and Ina Claire really date the film. Douglas, as he was in a lot of movies I've seen with him, is not a likable guy. He can be very annoying, but some of that is because he's doing such a fine acting job.""Ninotchka"" develops into a nice romance story in the second half of the movie with a short, satisfying ending and a pointed comment about living in Russia, at that time, as opposed to a free country.

tt0031725,The Problems of Capitalism v. Communism solved by Parisian Champagne,10.0,"If any film is chosen by most people as the typical Ernst Lubtisch comedy, it is NINOTCHKA. TROUBLE IN PARADISE is usually pointed at as his best comedy, and his best musical comedy is THE MERRY WIDOW with Chevalier and MacDonald, but NINOTCHKA is the elegant comedy of some point that people recall. I think the real reason is that it is, for most people, the best known of Greta Garbo's movies (after all, she laughed in it), and it does dismiss Communism with such sweet aplomb.Actually it does not do so that well. It shows that given an opportunity to relax and speak one's mind, and not worry about informers and gulags, people will be happier. That is true, but one could also say (as Lubitsch would show in TO BE OR NOT TO BE, that a form of extreme capitalism mixed with racist ideals called Nazism could be just as deadly. Moreover, Leon (Melvin Douglas) does read up a bit on Marx and his theories, and has an interesting conversation with his elderly valet (Richard Carle). Douglas feels that Carle has been oppressed over the years as a servant. Carle, though, reminds him that while he does not mind that Douglas has not paid him in quite a while, the thought that in a Communist world he (Carle) would have to share his money with Douglas, frightens the hell out of him.Douglas is the lover of Grand Duchess Swanna (Ina Claire) whose property was appropriated by the Soviet Government in the Revolution. Her jewelry is now in Paris, in the hands of a trade mission led by Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, and Alexander Granach. They plan to use it to get needed farm equipment for the Soviet Union. Douglas goes to work to corrupt the three men, which is not too difficult, so he can try to get his hands on the jewels for Swanna. But the Russians send an additional member to head the mission: Garbo as Ninotchka. She is quite hard nosed and business like. Ruman and company try to get her to understand what is going on is a good thing, but she keeps reminding what they are there for. She is not impressed that she is in the ""City of Lights"". Instead, on her first afternoon in Paris, she is determined to see the city's power plant! Douglas sees her and is instantly charmed, but she keeps resisting his efforts. Her background is quite different from what he is used to - we learn, for instance, that she actually distinguished herself in the Russo - Polish war of 1920 - 21, getting wounded, but killing the Polish soldier who wounded her (and comforting him as he died). She is not without a heart, but she is determined to do her duty. What finally breaks her down is not Douglas' attempts at romance, but his making a fool of himself trying to tell her a joke.She does break down, but she never loses sight of the reason for her mission. And she and Swanna finally reveal their willingness to sacrifice in a showdown scene, where the Grand Duchess gives up the jewels for Leon, while Ninotchka gives up Leon for the needs of her country.Leon too grows, determined to try to bring her back. The scene between Douglas and George Tobias is one of the funniest in the movie, as Douglas desperately offers to return to Soviet Russia, and Tobias (knowing what people like Douglas think of the Soviet regime) refuses to give him a visa (he might try to blow up a dam!).How he succeeds in the end I will leave to the viewer to find out. My only other comment is that this film is also recalled as the only time Greta Garbo shared a scene with Bela Lugosi, as her supervisor Commissar Razinin. It is only a three minute scene, and has only one funny line for Bela (describing the antics of Ninotchka's old mission buddies). He seemed stern and properly in control of his job, but he was far more funny in INTERNATIONAL HOUSE.Please also note Sig Ruman's comment to Garbo, asking her if she wanted to be alone. It is an interesting little reference to her most famous line of dialog from GRAND HOTEL, six years before.",19,25,True
tt0031725,"A Lovable Garbo, the Lubitsch Touch and Scintillating Wit from Wilder and His Cronies",9.0,"While it's a given that Greta Garbo was the most enigmatic of film stars during Hollywood's golden age, it's also fair to state that she may be the least relevant today for her austere beauty and cool, sometimes unapproachable demeanor. Yet, all that is erased with this 1939 comedy masterwork which brilliantly teams her with the master of innuendo-filled scintillation, Ernst Lubitsch. With a laser-sharp, witty script by Walter Reisch, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder (before he became a master director himself), this classic is one part political comedy, one part screwball farce and one part romantic whimsy, all blended impeccably with the famous Lubitsch touch.The plot involves Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to ensure that the government receives the proceeds from the sale of jewels once owned and still coveted by the Grand Duchess Swana, now an expatriate. The cold, emotionless envoy goes about superseding the three lesser envoys who have been assimilating themselves into the frivolous, capitalistic world of Paris thanks to Count Leon, a tuxedoed dandy and the duchess's constant escort. It is Leon who dubs the envoy Ninotchka, and after initial resistance, the two find themselves falling in love but not at the expense of her convictions about the omnipotence of Communist values. The jewels become a negotiation ploy that complicates their affair as does the Grand Duchess herself. The plot develops in unexpected ways and through such clever observational humor that the ending comes all too soon.While she is deified by many for the operatic tragedy of ""Camille"" and the mannered mystique of ""Mata Hari"", Garbo seems at first to be a parody of her sullen screen image with witty one-liners delivered in hilarious deadpan, but she, like her character, blossoms into a warm, comically romantic presence as the film progresses. It's a wondrous transformation and the one performance that assures Garbo her lasting stature more than any other. As Leon, Melvyn Douglas specialized in William Powell-knockoff roles like this one and while he does get a bit excessive in his 1930's-style romantic gestures, he is sophisticated and genial enough to have us believe Ninotchka may give up Mother Russia for him.At first, stage legend Ina Claire seems like she will play the Grand Duchess Swana as a dotty ninny, but when her talons show, she is an excellent match for Garbo in their scenes together. As the trio of envoys ensconced in the good life, Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach make a merry chorus to the proceedings. I particularly like the scenes back in Russia when they share an omelet dinner with Ninotchka in her Soviet-sanctioned, multiple-occupant room. The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is pristine and brings out William Daniels' sparkling, black-and-white cinematography, though the only extra is the film's original trailer. This is truly a must-see.",22,25,False
tt0031725,Works Much Better Than You Might Expect,,"For having a rather odd combination of elements, ""Ninotchka"" works better than you would expect. It would be well worth seeing solely for the chance to see Greta Garbo in a comedy, and she herself comes off very well. The story is light but entertaining, and it is mostly enjoyable in itself, while also providing an interesting look at contemporary attitudes towards the USSR.Garbo shows that she can handle the light comedy well, and although her character's transformation is somewhat stylized, this seems to be deliberate, rendering moot the otherwise obvious questions of believability. Melvyn Douglas makes an unusual pairing for Garbo, and he only partially works. His style can often become overly ingratiating, and while there are movies where that style fits in well, it is less than ideal here. A different choice for the role might have changed the feel of the movie for the better.Garbo's three Soviet comrades are possibly the best part of the picture. Felix Bressart and Sig Rumann, in particular, are impossible to forget. The roles are well-written and are used well in the story. Bela Lugosi is also in the supporting cast, but unfortunately he does not get a lot to do. The implied commentary on the nature of the (then) fairly young USSR is of some interest in itself, in comparison with the later attitudes of the post-war era.Overall, while ""Ninotchka"" has some uneven stretches, it is quite an enjoyable and interesting film that generally succeeds with its offbeat mix of cast and material.",15,25,False
tt0031725,Interesting and amusing period piece,5.0,"The film Ninotchka is more interesting for it's depiction of Communism, Russian stereotypes and Cold War American attitudes than the storyline itself. When it was released in 1939, US and Russian relationships were at a high point, so the popular conception was that the movie's message was simply that the Russian people were just like us and that anyone would be Capitalist if they could only be exposed to it. With the signing of the Soviet/Nazi non aggression pact, the film suddenly became a damning indictment of the Communist regime, but when the US and Russia became allies during the Second World War, it suddenly transformed into a cheerful reminder of the humanism of the Eastern bloc.As a result, it is most likely to appeal to Cold War historians and fans of Greta Garbo rather than cinephiles at large. Watching it nowadays though, it shows a cheerfully naive solution to the escalating, alien threat of Communism: love and laughter. Ninotchka, a stern Russian authoritarian on a mission to Paris remains highly critical of what she sees as bourgeois Capitalism until she develops a growing relationship with a middle-aged playboy. At first, their passion is for her, simply a perfunctory obligation, but when he manages to break her steely features with uproarious laughter in the pivotal scene at a working men's restaurant, her demeanour changes.Suddenly, Greta Garbo's robotic woman becomes open to the possibilities of romance. Her emotional reactions to their affair grow ever more passionate and she winds up yearning to be beautiful like the Parisian courtesans. She noticeably starts wearing more make up and upon returning to Moscow, finds the city to be drab and lifeless. In these later scenes, the reasons for the movie being banned in Soviet Russia couldn't be more obvious, for Communism is a suffocating pall that hangs over its citizens lives and where freedom is but a mask that hides a dictatorial, oppressive Government.Certainly, in terms of academic writing there's plenty for the historians to chew on, but in layman's terms the film is really, a bit flat. Garbo of course is an undeniable star and she gives Ninotchka's transformation a sense of realism that is lacking in the script. Melvyn Douglas on the other hand may be charming, but is ultimately nothing more than another romantic male lead from the 1930's, willing to declare his undying love for a woman he has only known for a few days. Given the nature of the storyline, their relationship occupies most of the running time but is too straightforward in its approach to be satisfying. It is simply another pattern of meeting, falling in love despite the initial strain, coming into a difficulty, overcoming it, coming into a greater difficulty and then when all seems lost, reuniting at the finale for plenty of those clichéd classical Hollywood kisses where they rub cheeks together after a passionate meeting of the lips.However, the movie has another selling point beyond Greta Garbo and that comes in the shape of the trio of Russian delegates Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski. Their storyline introduces us to the movie overall as they are sent to Paris ahead of Ninotchka, but instead of being serious Communists, they come across more as three cheeky young men, playfully enjoying the hitherto unexplored delights of Royal Hotel Suites and French Maids in revealing outfits. They provide some of the biggest laughs of the film, even when they are not on screen and it's a pity they don't get more exposure as they are far more endearing than the romantic plot.In short then, an interesting period piece but not one that stands the test of time. A lot of the humour has grown stale and while Garbo fans will lap it up, its most interesting selling point for today's audiences is in providing an example of how Hollywood handled the early years of the Cold War.",7,24,False

In fact, he was for me completely unconvincing; and the plot seemed much more concerned with East-West politics and ideologies than with any kind of romance.

Also a great political satire - mocking the evil of Soviet Russia and the naivety and stupidity of communism with some great satire. Capitalism doesn't get off scot-free either: the superficiality of some elements of it are also exposed.The opening few scenes also give a great insight into the European zeitgeist of the mid/late-1930s, especially the competing forces of capitalism, communism and fascism/nazism.From this auspicious start, a monumentally great movie was in the offing. However, from a point the movie takes itself far too seriously as a romantic drama. Instead of a political satire, or just plain comedy, it becomes a schmaltzy romantic drama, and a fairly predictable and conventional one at that.Even the humour becomes tired, predictable, more-of-the-same, rather than the fresh, sharp comedy from the first few scenes. The final few scenes are quite dull.It's as if the writer, the legendary Billy Wilder, ran out of ideas about half way through.Good performance by Greta Garbo as Ninotchka.

Perhaps it was due to her over-acting or perhaps it was due to the way the part was written or directed, but regardless her version of a Russian Commisar was more a silly stereotypical caricature than a real performance. And what a shame it was, because once her character magically transformed into a ""real woman"", her performance was indeed magical. Watching her smile and laugh was great--and not what you'd expect from this big screen diva. Along the way, the film is very ably supported by wonderful character actors (such as Sig Rumund and Felix Bressart). Melvin Douglas is really engaging in the film provided you ignore that he has no French accent whatsoever--yet he plays a French nobleman. Well, regardless of these quibbles, the real star is the light and engaging direction and cute script (apart from Garbo's first 15 minutes).

tt0031725,Tenderized Comrade,10.0,"When I saw this film first, perhaps twenty years ago, I was so ignorant of things Russian that I thought the Garbo character had actually been christened Ninotchka and/or it was a genuine Christian name. Since then I've learned that Russians have a charming habit of 'tenderising' names by adding a suffix so that Nina, for example, can be 'tenderized' to Ninotchka. I saw the film again recently in Paris where one Art House in particular seems to run virtually continuous Lubitsch retrospectives. When I saw it recently I knew that Ninotcka had been christened Nina and you know what? It didn't make that much difference. It was a GREAT movie when I saw it first and it's STILL a Great movie, tenderizer or not. I'm also slightly astounded that on the credits on this Board the name of Billy Wilder is omitted (unless, you click on 'more') which is not unlike omitting the names of Lubitsch and Garbo because apart from the Lubitsch 'touch' the Wilder touch is evident in every frame. On this board you will find a large selection of 'quotations' from the film, arguably as many if not more than yielded by Casablanca and in every one the caustic tongue of Wilder is clearly detectable. In fact the whole film reeks of Wilder and his penchant for what we might call the cyanide soufflé, the light-as-air romantic comedy laced with cynical barbs directed - in this case - mostly at the Russia of Stalin. I've looked in vain for a dull moment, every observation is right on the money, the characters are flesh and blood as opposed to cardboard and the leading character undergoes the obligatory volte face two thirds of the way through.

tt0032155,"Symbol, history, and myth.",10.0,"In his otherwise excellent book, Lincoln in American Memory, the historian Merrill Peterson calls Young Mr.Lincoln a ""boring, dreadful, film"". This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics. I am working on a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. As part of my preparation for writing the dissertation, I made  a careful analysis of this film, and of Tag Gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on Ford. Young Mr. Lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of Ford's cinematic authorship, 1939.In that greatest of Hollywood years, Ford directed three superb, still not fully appreciated films: Drums Along the Mohawk, Stagecoach,and Young Mr.Lincoln. It might seem odd to say that Stagecoach is not fully appreciated, all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest Westerns, and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time. However, what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy-a triptych, in fact. Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen. Drums Along the Mohawk is the Revolutionary War. Young Mr.Lincoln is pre-Civil War America.Finally, Stagecoach is Post Civil War America. What the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the American Adam and his ""errand into the Wilderness"". What are the Psychic and social costs of American manifest destiny, as America strives to build a new human city in the wilderness?Lincoln symbolizes Americas journey, as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse (law), with the freedom of the wilderness.Young Mr.Lincoln is not history, ( It is  full of historical ""howlers'-as both Ford and Trotti were well aware), but myth. This is Lincoln, the symbol of justice and mercy, Lincoln, the man of the wilderness, striving to found a civilization within himself, and to become the ""remarkable  lawgiver' of young America. Young Mr. Lincoln is not history-like James Agee's long forgotten teleplay about Lincoln, and like Sandburgs biography, it is an epic poem...a very beautiful epic poem.",62,69,False
tt0032155,A Jackleg Prarie Lawyer,9.0,"Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director/star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge.John Ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the Great Emancipator, but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer. That being settled Fonda headed a cast that John Ford directed into a classic film.This is not a biographical film of Lincoln. That had come before in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey did the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.But as Ford said, Fonda wasn't playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film encompasses about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him clerking in a general store, getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaving Lincoln a most melancholy being.Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice. He's served a couple of terms in the legislature, but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him.This is where the bulk of the action takes place. The two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff. The trial itself is fiction, but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case Lincoln defended. I'll say no more.Other than the performances, the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town in a Fourth of July celebration. It's almost like you're watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing.Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the tune Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays Mary Todd is the same one Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to, in My Darling Clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in Tombstone. Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons, I believe. The first is he's the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the background Lincoln came from. And secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some necessary political reasons. His assassination assured his place in history.Besides Fonda and others I've mentioned special praise should also go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two town louts, Kohler being the murder victim and Bond the chief accuser. Also Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in, you can't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.",38,42,False
tt0032155,Young Lincoln Gets the 'Ford' Treatment!,9.0,"1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and John Ford directed three of the best, ""Stagecoach"", ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union, ""Young Mr. Lincoln"".With the world plunging into a war that America dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, Abraham Lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", with Raymond Massey's physically dead-on portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, ""Abraham Lincoln: The War Years"", was published, and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of, in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"").All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck, at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's screenplay of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda, to star.Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'Great Emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. Even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the Lincoln of Legend, but a young ""jackanape"" country lawyer facing his first murder trial. Humbled, Fonda took the role. (John Ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) Obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.Unlike the introverted, melancholia-racked Lincoln of ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"", Ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). Injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in Ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. After her death, Lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme Ford would continue in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"").A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the big-city 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek, and his slick 'advisor', Stephen Douglas, played by a young Milburn Stone), and the informal, rule-bending country sense of Lincoln. With Ford 'regular' Ward Bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.With the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.""Young Mr. Lincoln"" is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year!",37,40,False
tt0032155,"Great Ford, and Great Americana",,"Why does this movie get so little attention? Maybe because it came out in that overstuffed great-movie year, 1939 (Wizard of Oz, Dark Victory, Grand Illusion, GWTW [which I can't stand]). But I really think it's because YML is a transitional film for Ford -- it's stuck between his early expressionistic period (""The Informer"") and his classic Western period, with one stylistic foot in each. And it's unabashedly patriotic, only hinting at the dark reimagining of the American experience that the Master would come to in ""The Searchers"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" -- but still hinting at it enough to turn off the McVeighs among us.Maybe that's why I love it. You can see Ford coming to terms with the grand, Griffithesque vision of America through its most complicated avatar, Lincoln. Ford's love for his country was more like Lincoln's than Griffith's, anyway: like Lincoln, he acknowledged the genius of the democratic experiment, but he was also aware of its dangers: mob rule and self-satisfaction. YML's greatest scenes are all about this.First, there's the local parade Abe attends, surrounded by yahoos whom he loves but also sees for what they are. (We see him in another scene accepting a legal case from one of these -- and warily biting the coin offered him for a retainer.) Veterans of the recent War of 1812 and Indian Wars march through; the crowd is wild for them, Abe merely respectful.Then a agon of old men in tricorners is pulled through the parade route. No one seems to know who they are. Lincoln quietly informs his friends that they are veterans of the War for Independence -- and gravely doffs his stovepipe hat. His friends, mildly ashamed (it appears) of their prevous jingoistic glee, follow suit, and stand silent and hatless as the old men pass.Then the mildly ludicrous plot -- about two brothers accused of another man's murder -- kicks in, and Abe goes to work. The scene where he confronts a lynch mob, putting his foot up against the log they're using for a battering-ram against the jailhouse door, is a classic by any standard. But note how Abe talks to the mob on its own level while remaining, in spirit, resolutely on his own higher plane. After appealing to their macho impulses by offering to ""lick any man here,"" he delivers a house-divided speech that soothes their savagery and leaves them confused and irresolute. ""Dontcha wanna put that log down now, boys?"" he asks when they have been flummoxed by his eloquence. ""Ain't it gettin' a mite heavy?""Throughout Ford indulges in shameless historical foreshadowings that would have made Stephen Vincent Benet blush. Abe meets Mary Todd and Stephen Douglas; he rides down a dirt road with a bumpkin who's playing a new tune called ""Dixie"" on a jaw-harp. ""Kinda makes you feel like marchin'!"" says the bumpkin, as he and Abe ride through a muddy patch in the road.The ending is impossible to describe without inviting derision, but I swear to you, it works. Having won his case, Lincoln allows as how he might take a walk -- ""maybe to the top of that hill."" As he trudges on, the skies send down rain and lightning -- and Abe seems to know what this is a prelude to.I acknowledge the superiority of the great Ford films that came after, but I will always have a special place in my heart for ""Young Mr. Lincoln."" Independence Day (the federal day of observance, not the movie) is coming; you could do far worse than to watch this great film before the barbecue.",31,38,False

There are some interesting talks by ""Abraham Lincoln"" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending is touching as Lincoln walks off and they superimpose his Memoral statue over the screen.It's a nice story, well-acted and such....but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there.

tt0032155,"YOUNG MR. LINCOLN (John Ford, 1939) ***1/2",9.0,"This film was not only one of John Ford's own personal favorites but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among its high-profile admirers. Ironically, I've just caught up with it myself via Criterion's recent 2-Disc Set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on Italian TV many years ago and again a few times on TV while in Hollywood! The film marked Ford's first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford's folksy Americana vein. A beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work, the courtroom sequences (and eventual revelation) in its second half still pack quite a wallop, apart from giving stalwart character actor Donald Meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorney.Fonda is, of course, perfectly cast as a bashful, inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become President; Fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film - most notably in Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it's surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of Lincoln since, in his view, that was ""like playing God""! It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously tackled Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a superb but perhaps little-known gem which has, luckily, just been released as a Special Edition DVD by the UK's veritable Criterion stand-in, Eureka's ""Masters Of Cinema"" label. Besides, I also have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection which I've yet to watch and, incidentally, both were directed by D. W. Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and, had I not just received a bunch of films I've never watched before just now, I would have gladly given them a spin based on my highly-satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR.

While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his portrayal of him as an ""aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy"" seemed a little insulting.;[Granted, that was Bushie Jr.'s whole campaign, to make us think he was ""just a regular guy""  so we wouldn't care that he's a rich & privileged moron -- but that's a whole other story.];Not only did the film show Lincoln as sort of a simple (almost simple-minded) kind of guy , the film states that Lincoln just sort of got into law by accident, and that he wasn't even that interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights & wrongs.  In the film he's not a very good defense attorney (he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the outcome is mostly determined by chance/luck.;Furthermore, partly because this was financed by Republicans (in reaction to some play sponsored by Democrats that had come out) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative.;Don't waste your time on this film!",4,18,False

tt0032155,Delicious with a grain of salt,7.0,"According to John Ford's lyrically shot, fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in ""the worst way."" Ford's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln's early life. But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film, what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling a story. The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee, one of his best roles.The film concerns two young men, brothers, on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. In classic angry mob style, the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them, until honest Abe steps into the fray. He charms them with his humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer. What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter, as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge, jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links.The film plays out like many John Ford movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite the overtly 'Hollywood' feel of the film, and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed, if you can take your drama with a grain of salt.",16,17,False
tt0032155,My least favorite Ford film,5.0,"Sad to say, but this was the first John Ford movie that I did not like (and I've seen more than 20). This is the story of Abraham Lincoln's first trial as a defense attorney, working on behalf of two young men who were accosted by a deputy brandishing a pistol. Henry Fonda does not give one of his better performances as Lincoln. He seems uncomfortable, and looks particularly terrible in his make-up. Of the other actors in the film, the only two worth mentioning are Donald Meek, who plays the prosecuting attorney, and Ward Bond, the victim's best friend and a witness to the crime. The prologue to the film is corny, as is a lot of the rest of the film. I'm not a fan of courtroom dramas, and this aspect of Young Mr. Lincoln is one of the worst examples of that genre that I can think of. People often criticize Ford for injecting ill-fitting humor into his pictures, but I was never bothered by anything like that until this film. Lincoln is constantly cracking jokes, and the jury and audience are always laughing uproariously at them. The only scene I thought was really successful was the one where Lincoln stops the lynch mob. That dialogue is very good. Otherwise, I was very disappointed in this one. 5/10.",6,14,False

John Ford's excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied laws , common law and began practice as a lawyer in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days, initial relationship to Mary Todd (Weaver), going on the couple from their first ball, and his departure for congress candidate . But it focuses mainly on two brothers (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) accused for murder, subsequent trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection from their mum (Alice Brady) . The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant.Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic ,traveller Springfield solicitor , he was to star regularly for John Ford from this movie , as ¨Grapes of wrath"" ,""My darling Clementine"" , and ""Fort Apache¨. Besides, sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother , she was a great actress from the silent cinema to early sound , but this one resulted to be her last movie because she early died due to cancer .

tt0032155,Corny early Ford,3.0,"Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you were to watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others. i.e. Grand Hotel is comparatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there's always the hard-sell of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the over-emphasis of some heavy's badness. Always the poorly crafted, awkward and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment. And sentiment is all this has going for it.What Ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the States were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It feels entirely false. Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre.

I was not expecting such a wonderful portrayal by Mr. Fonda and the accuracy (within Hollywood limits of the time) by Mr. Ford.  I am no Lincoln historian, but I have read enough about him that I recognize the truth in the spirit of this film.  A number of details could certainly be noted as historically inaccurate; on the other hand, the image of Mr. Lincoln as a lawyer who cares for people, truth, and mercy is quite accurate.  One reviewer writes that Mr. Lincoln is made to appear as a country bumpkin, using humor when he is unable to use anything useful.  To the contrary, Mr. Lincoln was realistic about his country origins; he used humor to convince, drive home an important point, and win people to his view; he was self-effacing.  The manner in which Mr. Fonda portrays him in this film does homage to the man. The film may conflate history for entertainment purposes (it is, after all, a Hollywood production), but it is not as unhistorical as many believe. While sentimental (as to be expected of a 1939 film about an American icon), Young Mr. Lincoln is an admirable presentation of the spirit of the man.",9,13,False
tt0032155,Young Henry Fonda is young Mr. Lincoln,9.0,"Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like.  It is a fooler.  Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin.  But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.  In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor.  It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect.  There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard.  He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War.  He goes forward into history.  The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous.  Definitely worth seeing again.",11,12,False

But make no mistake, this is narratively slow. It admires and over simplifies the man. And it has one main event that turns into a courtroom trial filled with caricatures and clichés. In short, this is a movie whose audience has disappeared.Yes it's well made, and to Ford we can still admired a smart director. Fonda is likable, but isn't especially convincing as a Lincoln kind of young man. There are lots of extended scenes (beyond the courtroom drama itself), such as a dance with its revelry. If you want to feel transported to the late 1850s you might find these parts of the movie work well, but for me even this basic movie trait is thin and not totally enjoyable.And it's history. There will be no surprise. He doesn't die of typhoid, survive a duel, discover some new medicine, fall in love with an actress, or change and transform in complex ways. He's the future president, and there are limitations imposed by the facts. And by respect.Should you see this?

tt0032155,Entertaining but enough to give history teachers a stroke!,5.0,"If you are looking at this film purely for its entertainment and production values, it's not bad. However, I heartily agreed with the quote from Henry Fonda (who played Lincoln) that ""I felt as if I were portraying Christ himself on film."" The bottom line is that the film loses a lot of credibility because Lincoln is a caricature in the film--a man too pure, too good and too unlike us have been a real person. This silly super-humanness is made worse by the script--one that is the exact opposite of the old TV motto from ""Dragnet"". Instead of changing the names the protect the innocent, this film keeps the names but completely changes the facts to suit a Hollywood need to make Lincoln a saint. This is true in this film and is even more apparent in films like D. W. Griffith's dull biopic of Lincoln (1930).The myths are many, but a few I'll tackle are Anne Rutledge and the trial that took up about 75% of the movie. As for Rutledge, historians will agree that Lincoln knew this lady--but as for a romance between them, most doubt this ever occurred. At the same time, there is a lot that we DO know about Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd, but in this film she has almost no personality and has no impact on Abe. So, this is an odd case where a myth is promoted and a true story (the marriage) is omitted--even though it was VERY fascinating and could make a great movie in itself (Mary was an odd and rather crazy lady). As for the trial, it actually DID occur--but the events were very very different. And, you'd think that based on its title the film would have a lot more to do with Lincoln and his early life! So who is this film good for, then? Well, people who like somewhat dull biopics that are fictionalized would love this film and perhaps John Ford fans would like it--though ford himself was not happy about the project--much of it because the studio insisted on injecting some pretty sappy myths into it beyond what you already had in the original script. Frankly, I think a comic book version of Abe's life or even ""Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" might be more informative!",6,11,True

There was no one better to play Lincoln than Henry Fonda, with his willowy frame and haunted eyes. But director John Ford seems too intent on myth making to manufacture a drama that we care about. It's hard to have an emotional reaction to a myth.This film feels decidedly stoic and ponderous, showcasing none of the fluidity and crispness that Ford's own ""Stagecoach,"" released the same year, has.Rather dreary and dull.Grade: C",3,11,False
tt0032155,The greatest story never told,8.0,"There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'Young Mr Lincoln'. Abraham Lincoln was one of the most fascinating and most important historical figures and a major part of American history. While Henry Fonda is not one of my favourite actors, he did give a number of fine performances and his best films such as '12 Angry Men' are milestones. Have for a long time thought very highly of John Ford. 1939 was also such a great year for film.'Young Mr Lincoln' for me is not quite one of the best or most influential films of 1939 (close though), but it is both very enjoyable and interesting. Those that know little or nothing about Lincoln prior to watching and watched because of being a fan of classic film, Fonda and/or Ford, are likely to want to learn more about him. Anybody expecting historical accuracy are best looking elsewhere and it is understandable if some find it too hagiographic today. On its own merits, 'Young Mr Lincoln' is well worth watching and is a very good representation of both Fonda and Ford.It's not without caveats. Some have found, or find, the first portion on the too slow side, and am going to include myself in this category where the story is a little too slight.Not all the humour quite works, most of it does but some of it is silly and doesn't always fit easily with what happens or add much.Fonda however is cast perfectly, the only debit being that distracting false nose through no fault of his own. He is very commanding throughout while never taking things too seriously (quite a lot of his delivery is playful). Alice Brady brings a lot of heart to her role and it was great fun seeing Donald Meek and Ward Bond playing their roles with authority and relish. Ford did not once seem uninterested or uncomfortable, lots of sensitivity and energy. The characters don't feel like caricatures and are easy to engage with.While 'Young Mr Lincoln' is a slow starter, when it gets more eventful it is very involving and has a good deal more energy. The courtroom stuff not only has genuine tension and intrigue but is playful fun too, thanks to a mostly beautifully balanced and intelligent script that keeps sentimentality at bay and generally has some amusing humour. Not mixed uneasily mostly as well. The ending is powerful. 'Young Mr Lincoln' is beautifully filmed and typically stirringly scored by the great Alfred Newman.Concluding, very good and interesting. 8/10",7,9,False
tt0032155,I was really disappointed with this film,7.0,"Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was just so weak. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker.

I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head.",5,8,False

Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly evoking early 19th century America.

tt0032155,John Ford Really Piles It On,6.0,"There was clearly no greater patriot in all of Hollywood than John Ford. A simple review of his filmography takes us from ""Stagecoach"" to ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", all the way through ""The Searchers"" and ""How The West Was Won"", Ford shows his love for his country. And he never let the idea of a good story get in the way of the truth about the real events that some of his films are based on.This is especially true with ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" a highly fictionalized accounting of the early days of Abraham Lincoln's law practice. If you are looking for insight about Mr. Lincoln, or a story about Mr. Lincoln's early political aspirations, forget about it. This is Ford's country and his stories are about ideals, his ideals, and if he can use an Abraham Lincoln or a Tom Joad, or an Ethan Edwards to communicate those ideals, than he will. And if he has to bend the truth a little, or even a lot, it doesn't really matter. The idea is to let the audience know what he believes America is, and how it should be.""Young Mr. Lincoln"" is not a great film, but it does have a pair of great performances. First and foremost is a wonderful portrayal of the, alternately melancholy and insecure Lincoln performed by Henry Fonda. Fonda is at the top of his game communicating the uneasiness, and insecurity of Lincoln.The other top performance is turned in by Alice Brady, as the mother of two defendants that Lincoln tries to clear. Her performance is nothing short of heartbreaking. All the rest of the cast( especially Ward Bond) does the requisite amount of mugging and upstaging that is customary in a Ford film.In conclusion, if you're looking for a history lesson, go elsewhere, if what you want is American idealism, look no further.",4,7,True
tt0032155,John Ford's masterpiece,10.0,"Undoubtedly one of the great John Ford's masterpieces, Young Mr. Lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release, no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released, including the most mythical Western in the history of the genre, John Ford's milestone Stagecoach and many others, such as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington which took the Oscar in the only category Young Mr. Lincoln was nominated for, which is Original Screenplay.    It continued to be the most underrated Ford's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other John Ford's masterpieces, but by the end of the 1950s American and European film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary Russian director Sergei Eisenstein about the Young Mr. Lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any American film ever made till then, it would be definitely John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln. Impressed by such an undoubted preference from Eisenstein, critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film's reputation has been increasing ever since.    It was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary American presidents was brought to the screen. Right in the beginning of the 1930s Griffith did it in his Abraham Lincoln and the same year as Ford's film, MGM released John Cromwell's one called Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful Broadway Stage Play released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood.    As far as John Ford's films are concerned, we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical Lincoln's figure in several of director's works, such as 1924 The Iron Horse or 1936 The Prisoner of the Shark Island, the second one, just as Young Mr. Lincoln, utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite Lincoln's song - Dixie.;   The screenplay based on a previously mentioned Stage Play and Lincoln's biographies was written by Lamar Trotti in collaboration with John Ford himself, which was quite a rare thing for Ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the Play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene, which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears generator, where Lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney (played by Donald Meek) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other.   Overall it's a very touching, heart-warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from Henry Fonda in his supreme characterization of Abraham Lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of John Ford's genius at one of its best deliveries ever. A definite must see for everyone. 10/10",3,7,False
tt0032155,"ABE LINCOLN, Attorney-at-Law",9.0,"YOUNG MR. LINCOLN (20th Century-Fox, 1939), directed by John Ford, with an original screenplay by Lamar Trotti, is not a film about the life of Abraham Lincoln, from log cabin to the White House, but a story about Lincoln's early years as a young lawyer. The story begins circa 1832 where Lincoln (Henry Fonda) age 23, is working as part owner of a general store in New Salem, Illinois. On their way west, the Clay family stop by the store in need of supplies, and explain to the young man that all they can do by way of payment is supply Lincoln with their supply of books, which he happily accepts. Through these books, Lincoln studies law and is encouraged by his sweetheart, Ann Rutledge (Pauline Moore), to become a lawyer. Some years later, after studying law, he opens up his law office in Springfield where he comes across the Clay family once more, this time working in their defense when one of widow Abigail Clay's (Alice Brady) sons, Adam and Matt (Eddie Quillan and Richard Cromwell), are accused of shooting and killing a man named ""Scrub"" White.Whether this story of Lincoln's years as a lawyer is accurate or fictional is uncertain, but it does make good story telling without straying apart from the person Lincoln was, a laid back man whose philosophy goes with his story telling. Henry Fonda would seem an unlikely choice to play Lincoln, but is acceptable in this role, with a make-up job that has him appear to look more like Lincoln than Lincoln did. Since nobody really knows how Lincoln sounded, he could very much had talked like Fonda. But Fonda's performance ranks one of the best in his career. The role of Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused young men, is given an excellent portrayal by Alice Brady, who sadly died of cancer the year of this film's release. Having watched many of her early film roles on television in which she was type-cast as air-headed society matrons in numerous comedies, such as THE GAY Divorcée (1934) or MY MAN GODFREY (1936), it's hard to believe that this is the same actress, a serious role as an uneducated pioneer woman whose sole interest is to save her two boys, but not tell which one of them is the guilty party, even if it means that both of them should be executed in hanging if found guilty. Had Brady lived, chances are she would have been reteamed opposite Henry Fonda in the John Ford directed masterpiece of THE GRAPES OF WRATH (1940), in the role of ""Ma"" Joad, as played in the final print by Jane Darwell, who won the Academy Award as Best Actress. But let's not forget Brady's did win such an honor for similar role as a pioneer woman, Mrs. O'Leary, in IN OLD CHICAGO (20th Century-Fox, 1937), starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye. In the supporting cast are Marjorie Weaver as Mary Todd; Arleen Whelan as Hannah Clay; Milburn Stone as Stephen A. Douglas; Ward Bond as John Palmer-Cass; Donald Meek as John Felder, the prosecuting attorney who disapproves of Lincoln's tactics in defending his clients. Meek's courtroom scenes with Fonda are one of the highlights in the story, adding humor to the story, along with Spencer Charters as Judge Herbert A. Bell, who, in one segment, snores while Felder is trying his case. In smaller roles seen in the early portion of the story are Jack Kelly as Matt, as a boy; Dickie Jones as Adam, as a boy; and Robert Homans as Mr. Clay, their father.YOUNG MR. LINCOLN expertly and leisurely paced under the direction of John Ford, concludes the same way as did D.W. Griffith's talkie bio-pic, ABRAHAM LINCOLN (UA, 1930), with the camera focusing on the Lincoln Memorial accompanied by the underscoring of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" Highly recommended for Lincoln buffs, and while YOUNG MR. LINCOLN ceases to air on local television these days annually on February 12th (Lincoln's birthday), as it did in decades past, formerly shown on American Movie Classics, it can be found today on the Fox Movie Channel or as a video rental or check out from a neighborhood library.One final note of interest: As Bob Dorian, former host of American Movie Classics, once mentioned during one of its TV presentations, is that one of the scenes cut from the final print of the film was Lincoln's brief encounter with a young actor named John Wilkes Booth as he is leaving a theater.

tt0032155,Hero worship,4.0,"I am not familiar enough with 19th-century American history to pick out all the details where 'Young Mr Lincoln' may deviate from actual events (for that, see Martin Hafer's review, 17 May 2011), but the approach taken by director John Ford makes me doubt seriously that what his film shows bears much relation to what happened in the 1830s in Illinois. What Ford gives us is a saint's legend fashioned in the same sycophantic way a Soviet director might have taken to approach the life of young gospodin Ulyanov (better known as V. I. Lenin). Lincoln, ably played by Henry Fonda (who certainly looks the part with heavy make up and a prosthetic nose), is too good to be true. Not that he does not have weaknesses (he lacks experience as a lawyer), but his character is absolutely flawless. The rest of the acting is also good, but what struck me is that throughout, the people in the film are not individuals; they are types: Donald Meek as the sharp prosecutor, Alice Brady as the honest, hard working widow and so on. Brady especially did a great job: I initially did not even recognise her, having seen her before in films such as 'My Man Godfrey' (1936) or 'One hundred Men and a Girl' (1937), where she plays essentially the same character - a scatterbrained elderly socialite. In sum, 'Young Mr Lincoln' is a well-acted film that is undermined by the fawning approach the director takes. Having decided to watch it because I saw the 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I must say I was disappointed.",2,6,False

Now I haven't seen it on any channel in years and it isn't available on VHS or DVD.This is just such a breath of fresh air for a 1940 movie. It's a movie where the woman is as smart as the man and is allowed to show it and in the end stands tall with him instead of behind him. The dialogue is funny, which given the exceptional writers like Billy Wilder, is not surprising. Colbert and Milland have wonderful chemistry. It's a movie I adore from start to finish.

tt0032220,Have a poo instead,3.0,"Ray Milland (Tom) is awaiting execution in Franco's Spain when he gets a last minute reprieve courtesy of his wife's intervention. Only his wife, Claudette Colbert (Augusta) isn't really his wife. She's a reporter looking for a story. They make a run for it when their deception is discovered and then the film plays out as a romance set against the beginning of World War 2.Basically, nothing happens in this film. It's very talky. The actors are just given too many words to rattle off to each other without the film ever going anywhere. After about an hour, when nothing had happened, I paused the film and went to have a poo. This gave me the very welcomed experience of actually being entertained as I got to read another chapter of my book – ""And I Don't Want To Live This Life"" by Deborah Spungen, mother of Nancy Spungen (as of Sid and Nancy fame/legend). When I resumed the film, it just continued in a very boring manner with not a lot happening and lots of words.Question – where are the Hebrides? The answer according to this film is off the coast of Ireland. Yeah, just like Spain is off the coast of Norway. At the beginning of the film, the best part, the soldier being executed marches in time with his executors to his fate. No way. Why is he marching in time to the tune of his enemy killers? While the 2 leads, Colbert and Milland, do work well together and are very likable stars, they unfortunately just get bogged down with sappy shenanigans. The story is just unbelievable tosh. I can't recommend it because the film is boring.",4,22,False
tt0032220,Claudette Colbert's favorite of her own films,8.0,"Claudette Colbert stated that Ernst Lubitsch was ""by far"" her favorite director, but this film, directed by Mitchell Leisen, she stated to be her favorite movie. Released in 1940, it marked her fourth collaboration with Leisen (he'd co-directed without credit sequences of the 1932 Cecil B. DeMille production ""Sign of the Cross,"" the movie which made Claudette a star), the man who directed her in more films than any other director.One can see why Claudette liked this film the best: it gave her a meatier role than the parts she'd played over the preceding several years. Ever since 1934's ""It Happened One Night"" Claudette had mostly done comedy films. This isn't a complaint – the lady had better comedic timing than just about any other actress in Hollywood. But here in Arise My Love she was able to cover the gamut of her talent, from comedy to drama, something she hadn't gotten to do since the Pre-Code years (check out her 1933 ""Torch Singer"" for an example). Indeed it's this mixture of genres which seems to offset the critics of today. For Arise My Love answers the unasked question: ""What if Casablanca had been done as a screwball comedy?"" Produced so in-the-moment that the script was rewritten daily to encompass the latest events, Arise My Love was released in 1940 and covers the hectic events of one year, starting in the summer of 1939. Claudette is Gusto Nash, a no-nonsense newspaper reporter who dreams of scoring big headlines. She frees Tom Martin (Ray Milland), a Nazi-hating pilot who's imprisoned on death row in Spain, part of the Liberty battalion of US soldiers who helped that country fight the encroaching Nazis (and lost). The first thirty minutes of this movie are 100% action, with escape via land and air. After this the film moves into screwball territory, with Tom hot for Gusto and Gusto trying to reign in her feelings; she wants to focus on her career. After this we move into drama; together at last, Gusto and Tom are soon separated, Gusto to cover the Nazi menace in various points of Europe, Tom battling the Germans in the Polish air force.Everything hangs together despite the mixing of genres. If I had any complaints it would be that the film ends a bit too weakly, Claudette delivering a passionate soliloquy to a silent Milland. Doubtless this gung-ho speech was intended to stir patriotic fervor in the audience of the day, but now, decades after WWII, it seems a bit anticlimactic. Indeed, the opening thirty minutes of the film are more climatic than the ending. But there are a lot of enjoyable moments. Claudette and Milland have good chemistry and both get a chance to display comedic and dramatic skills.The Sturges/Brackett script is up to the level of their previous Claudette productions (""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"" and ""Midnight""), though, again, they don't get as much chance here to unleash their trademark comedy. Leisen's direction is good, too, as is the cinematography and production values. Claudette and Milland traipse about Europe in a variety of locales, from Paris to countryside inns deep in France; all of it done on a set, all of it featuring that Classic Film glamor.Released well after the enforcement of the puritanical Code, Arise My Love still gets in a few surprises – first, there's a delightful scene where Gusto comes up to Tom's room to snap his photo for her article. Tom however thinks she's coming up for sex. This develops into a scene filled with hilarious misunderstanding, with Gusto arranging the setup and Tom becoming increasingly bewildered: ""So where shall we do it? How about the chair?"" ""What?"" ""Right – too conventional."" All of it like ""Three's Company,"" but still very funny. Also, shortly after this scene Gusto and Tom talk in a restaurant; Tom's pretending he's waiting for a (nonexistent) Swedish girl, but really he just wants to be with Gusto (who thinks she's just getting material for her article). There's a moment where Tom asks Gusto to pick out some flowers – flowers he pretends to be buying for the Swedish girl but are really for her. As Tom purchases the flowers she picked out, Gusto looks at him with a dawning understanding that turns into a look of longing – and then, very abruptly, she puts her pen in her mouth. Dr. Freud calling!Despite Claudette's preference for this film, it's never been officially released – not even on VHS.

tt0032220,"Smart, sassy and romantic",10.0,"Definitely in my all time top 10. The Milland/Colbert pairing is fantastic, there is wonderful chemistry between the two stars but it is Colbert who as the independent career woman Augusta Nash launched me on my love of 1930's/1940's films and I would recommend this as a fabulous example of what films of that era have to offer a modern audience. The opening sequences set the adventurous and romantic tone of the movie. The scenes in Maxim's and the in the horse drawn carriage on Monmartre are wonderfully romantic as Tom (Milland) plots to overcome Augusta's business only attitude. A fabulous film which gets home the patriotic message needed as WWII commenced without ever overwhelming the wonderful adventurous story.",18,18,False

Well worth a DVD release (can you hear me Universal!), but this inexplicably has never even made it on to VHS.It features a strong capable woman (a trademark Leisen feature), but her male counterpart is no weakling is either, Ray Milland matches Claudette Colbert all of the way, helping create dramatic interest.

tt0032220,And spite the envious moon!,9.0,"In the final analysis, a film is about cinematography. From the very beginning at the Spanish prison, extraordinary cinematography is used to an exceptional degree, and it continues through the film. There are minor exceptions, as with the file film of airplanes flying. More importantly, the film claims the obvious: The Spanish government in 1939 had more than casual leanings toward Berlin. The bombing of Guernica by the Nazi air force is testimony, here reinforced. Tom Martin (Ray Millard) says he had a pet rat in his jail cell named ""Adolph."" Spain's neutrality during World War Two is in question with Paramount Pictures, as it was in diplomatic circles. Of course, a 1940 movie about event of 1939 has the advantage of historical retrospect, yet the public actions of the Spanish government stand. Claudette Colbert as Agusta Nash is the career woman whose career comes before love, who puts her career before all. Her assignment as Special Berlin Correspondent is to tell of Hitler and his gang. A series of unpredictable events leads her to redefine her sense of patriotism. There are, in effect, many loves which must arise and spite the envious moon. Cinematography, historical theme, and some darn good acting all unite for an effective historical perspective on life at the beginnings of World War Two.",8,12,False
tt0032220,Smart but uneven blend of comedy and drama against background of impending WWII...,6.0,"Mitchell Leisen gets superb performances from CLAUDETTE COLBERT and RAY MILLAND in ARISE, MY LOVE.It's a comedy/drama with Claudette as a journalist tired of covering fluffy stories who decides to get into serious journalism by rescuing a man about to be executed during the Spanish Civil War (Milland) so that she can be the first writer to get a scoop on a great story. As soon as she and her prisoner meet, the deft comic timing of these two pros are given great support from Billy Wilder's clever script. Early on, there's a scene of mistaken intentions that has Ray thinking Claudette wants to seduce him. He's oblivious to the fact that she merely wants to take some photos of him for the article she intends to write. The double entendre dialog has seldom been matched, in this scene alone.Personally, I prefer ""Midnight,"" another Leisen/Colbert film shown before this one on TCM. It's even wittier and much funnier. The trouble with ARISE, MY LOVE is that it attempts to do too many things at once and emerges as an uneven romantic comedy with a war background. For the ending, Claudette gets to deliver a flag waving speech that is obviously meant for 1940 audiences who were facing the prospect of getting involved in WWII.Lots of laughs along the way with both stars delivering excellent performances.",11,11,False
tt0032220,The European Scene From 1939 To The End of June 1940,8.0,"This film is pretty good but oddly uneven. The script (which Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder both worked on) is about the adventures and experiences of soldier-of-fortune Ray Milland and reporter Claudette Colbert across western Europe from Spain to Germany and then to England. Colbert is working for an American syndicate out of Paris that is headed by Walter Abel. She goes to Spain, where the Spanish Civil War is ending with a Fascist victory. Milland is going to be executed (he's been fighting for the Republic), and Colbert tells the prison governor (George Zucco) that she is married to Milland. She is allowed to see Milland, and helps spirit him out of the prison for the sake of the interview and scoop. They get to France, and Milland proceeds to romance and slowly win Colbert. The rest of the film is done against the background of the worsening international crisis, seen first hand by our hero and heroine. Colbert does not like the Nazis, but she is slower on the realization that they are not limited in their goals but determined to spread control over as many peoples as possible. Milland (when not trying to break down Colbert's ""friends only"" point of view) is showing her the ropes of the real German led threat to Europe and the globe. The unevenness (despite having Wilder and Brackett working on the screenplay) is due to the nature of the light banter between the romantic leads, and the growing threat they observe. It is not a glaring weakness, but it seems to split the film in half at times.Sometimes it has a belated effectiveness in carrying out the warning of the movie. Abel is all business and hectic confusion (Esther Dale, as his secretary, helps keep him directed to his purposes) in sending Colbert to her jobs and getting her stories back to the U.S. At one point we find Milland and Colbert in Paris, with the latter doing his best to get Colbert to loosen up - taking her to Maxim's and other romantic nightspots in that city. It does eventually wear down her resistance to him. But late in the film it is June 1940, and Abel is on hand to see the entrance of the victorious Nazis into Paris. He has a very good moment when his business viewpoint dissipates in shock as he realizes the ""city of lights"" is in the hands of these modern barbarians. His comments at that moment make us think back to the brighter Paris we saw earlier in the sequences at Maxim's.*(*A curious sidelight: Although from different studios, the events of that June day play a role in Paramount's ARISE, MY LOVE, and Warner's CASABLANCA: Bogart and Dooley Wilson flee Paris (to avoid arrest from the Germans) by train, and Bergman deserts Bogart (to return to the wounded Paul Henreid) at the same time that Abel is watching the arrival of the same German troops.)Despite the unevenness the film is worth seeing. It has many good moments in it (including an unexpectedly bumbling Zucco - his usual evil control of events thwarted by his act of kindness to the pretty Colbert). It is also, as far as I know, the only movie to mention a forgotten war crime of the opening of the war: the torpedoing and sinking of the steamer Athenia off Ireland with loss of life. The incident (in September 1939) is not as recalled as the similar Lusitania incident of 1915 in the same waters because the losses were not as huge (fortunately). Oddly enough the Nazis were quick to be aware of the similarity, and the Goebbels propaganda machine cranked up a story that the British were responsible, not the Germans. Nobody believed it then or since.Despite it's somewhat split personality the film gets an ""8"" out of ""10"".",11,11,True
tt0032220,Just one of the best romances ever captured on film.,10.0,"I loved this film from beginning to end. It made me laugh and it made me cry, and it left me with the feeling that I had watched one of the best screen romances ever. The script was so wonderfully written, the dialogues really sparkled like diamonds and ... Ray Milland was handsomer here than in any other film I have seen him!! He treated Clodette Colbere with a mixture of humor ,tenderness and respect, that was very endearing and touching. At moments, he seemed like an insecure little boy, and I am sure that he was never like that with any other of his co-stars. Needless to say, I loved this aspect of his very much!!! Something else that I found interesting is that the film was made almost simultaneously with the historical events it describes. This adds to its authenticity and gives us a sense of watching history in the making. The mixing of comedy and drama does not annoy me. It is more than realistic and in fact welcome, here. We deal with two very smart and out of the ordinary people, living very unusual lives, taking active parts in what goes on around them, so it is to be expected that they will have an acute sense of humor as well as forceful feelings about the war and about each other. In our lives there is place for both comedy and drama, why it should not be so for a movie, who depicts life? Just to add that the DVD now available, (spanish edition but with English audio)has very good quality of sound and picture, and does justice to this uniquely beautiful film.",9,10,False
tt0032220,1940--the year Hollywood finally took off the gloves...,9.0,"Up until 1939 when Warner Brothers took Nazi Germany in ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"", Hollywood was very silent about Hitler and the Third Reich. Part of this was because the American public was staunchly neutral towards Germany and the war. In fact, Hitler had been a rather popular guy in America! Another reason films didn't criticize this repressive regime was because Congress had enacted some unconstitutional legislation that prevented Hollywood for taking a stance towards or against any side in the conflict in Europe! However, starting in 1940, the studios finally declared their independence and a wide variety of anti-Nazi films were released--the tide had finally turned though it wouldn't be until almost 1942 that the US finally got pulled into the war. With films like ""Storm Warning"", ""Escape"" and ""Arise, My Love"" were just a few of the 1940 anti-Nazi films.The movie finds Ray Milland in a Spanish prison awaiting execution after his capture by Franco's Nationalist troops. If you don't remember your history classes, these Nationalists were allies with the Germans and they provided assistance during this civil war--as they wanted to try out all their cool new weapons on the Republican soldiers. As Milland is awaiting death, he laments that he wishes he could live long enough to fight the Nazis directly--a distinctly anti-neutrality statement! However, just before he is shot, his wife shows up and is granted a pardon if he just agrees to leave the country. However, Milland is NOT married and Colbert is actually a crazy reporter who is trying to do a good thing AND get a great story! When this is discovered, the two beat a hasty retreat across the border to France.Soon, the couple are hanging out in Paris. Milland is now a bit of a celebrity and Colbert decides to stick by him to get a story--though the story seems over and you wonder what Colbert really wants. Not surprisingly, the two soon fall in love. But, oddly, Colbert fights hard NOT to fall for Milland and only when she shares a train car on the way to a new assignment in Berlin does she finally give in to Milland's advances. Instead of continuing the journey, they take a brief vacation together--during which WWII begins when the Germans invade Poland. Now the couple are unsure what to do next. Should they go back to America and settle down to a life or domesticity or should they stay and do their part to battle the Fascists? When they chose the safer life in America, things don't go as they'd expect as the ship is sunk by a Nazi sub. This ship, the SS Athenia, was actually the first British ship sank in the war. They survive but what's next?! Try seeing the movie yourself to find out what the two lovers decide to do now.This film is among the most romantic films Milland or Colbert made in their very distinguished careers. But, it is unusual in that it also has such a highly serious side to it as well--and you know the romance is fated as well--providing a wistful tone of the film. It comes off very well and the dialog sparkles...and it has a timely political message as well. Extremely well done and enjoyable.",9,9,True

It was Claudette Colbert's own favourite among her films, and you'll understand some of its qualities better when you study the list of the script writers, one of whom was the young Billy Wilder. The dialog is brilliant all the way, there is any amount of eloquent scenes, and the romance gradually grows quite naturally with some skirmishes along the way. Walter Abel also gives one of his best performances as Claudette Colbert's employer, as he also gets his nose too far out into the business. Claudette Colbert is a journalist who goes to Spain to get out an American prisoner, who awaits his execution. That is Ray Milland, and the very first scene is perhaps the very best one, as Ray Milland sits in his cell waiting for his execution playing cards with a priest, while the firing squad is busy just outside, leaving one body just outside Ray Milland's window in a shadow that won't go away. Add to this the romantic music of Victor Young, which adorns many of the long romance scenes, while gradually the comedy transcends into a major war drama, with some curious coincidences on the way: on the train to Berlin, both Ray and Claudette being together on it, the emergency break is pulled just as the war breaks out, and when Ray and Claudette decide to leave all career thinking behind and go back to America to embark on a normal life, their ship gets torpedoed, and the war starts for real.It's a delightful and innovative comedy all the way, eloquently mixed with some very serious business, and the film is so positive and edifying, that it would be worth returning to it every once in a while - it's the perfect emergency readiness film.",3,3,False

As someone else has commented there is too much talking .Sometimes a surreptitious glance or a nervous laugh can express a depth of love that all the ""I love yous ""in the world fail to match. Colbert obviously remembered this film with great affection,possibly because of her dalliance with Milland and because of its propaganda use in the war effort-the Germans had invaded her country of birth . Colbert does well within the confines of the script ,but for one scene (when she rings her boss after the sinking of her boat)it is routine for this accomplished actress.

tt0032220,Spain And Abel,8.0,"This was the fourth out of six Paramount films for which Billy Wilder received a screenplay credit (he actually worked without credit on as many again) and the third of the six (after Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Midnight) to star Claudette Colbert but whilst the first two were out- and-out comedies Arise, My Love is a fine blend of drama and romantic comedy set against the outbreak of World War 11 and shot just as Paris fell to the Germans in 1940. Another difference between the first two films is that in both Colbert had sterling support from the likes of David Niven, Edward Everett Horton, John Barrymore, Mary Astor whilst here, she and co-star Ray Milland carry the bulk of the plot with Walter Abel sharing a handful of scenes. Although Wilder was unhappy with Mitchell Liesens' directing - he helmed several Wilder screenplays - and claimed that Liesen was the reason he fought to direct his own screenplays the fact is that Leisen makes a fairly decent fist of a fine screenplay and coaxes excellent performances out of the two stars.",3,3,True
tt0032220,"Adventure, career, news and wartime love story",9.0,"""Arise, My Love"" is billed as a comedy-romance and drama. But, this film is as much a war story for its time and setting. A blossoming love is the core of the film, around which a myriad of small adventures and escapades coalesce. Indeed, the setting of early wartime Europe provides the basis for the love story. The humor is peppered throughout the film, mostly with its main characters. And like other films of this period - from the early months before to the start of WW II, this movie gives a look at the news media of the day and the American news sources in Europe.Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland are excellent in their roles of Augusta Nash and Tom Martin. ""Gusto"" Nash gives another side plot view of a woman striving for a professional career above all else. Walter Abel is excellent as the Associated News Agency European chief, Phillips, and adds to much of the humor. Colbert and Milland work well, and have a good chemistry that makes their roles believable as they segue from the humorous to the serious and a deep love. The rest of the supporting cast are fine, but beyond Phillips, few other roles have much substance. This is a film that is heavily weighted with the two leads and leading supporting role of Abel's.The production values and direction are very good in handling a fairly complex script with so many deviations and diversions. The script is mostly very good, but toward the end it skips over a chapter in which Tom is injured while flying against the Germans in Norway.The film has a lot of action, and touches on several historical events, albeit with the fictional characters involved. Nash rescues Martin from a Spanish firing squad in a clever plot. The two commandeer a plane on the ground and flee pursuing fighter planes. Later, they are among the survivors of the British passenger ship, Athenia. A German submarine torpedoed the ship off the Coast of Ireland on Sept. 2, 1939. It was the first hostile action on the seas by Germany, even before the official start of WW II. The scenes filmed of the rescued lifeboats are quite dramatic on the Irish coastline.Tom and Gusto were on the ship after the U. S. government urged Americans to return home following Germany's conquest of France. Deeply in love, the couple plan to marry and contribute to the war effort back home. Instead of flying fighter planes and reporting the war headlines, they will take safer jobs where they can be together in Cleveland. Onboard the Athenia, they toasted farewell to their former selves - fighter pilot Tom Martin, and big name reporter Gusto Nash, and tossed the champagne glasses overboard. Now, on the beach after their rescue, as they decide to stay, Gusto says, ""God knew better. He threw us right back at them.""This movie premiered on Oct 17, 1940, in America - more than a year before the U. S. would enter World War II. It covers just a short period from after the Spanish Civil War (April 1939) through the fall of France in May of 1940. It's one of the few American films made well before the U. S. entered WW II, and it doesn't hold back on the criticism of Nazi Germany, expressed mostly by Milland's character, Tom Martin.With it's bouncing around from one place and event to another, ""Arise, My Love"" may lose some viewers. Those who know a little history of the time will find the details more interesting. But, history knowledge or not, most viewers should enjoy this film. It has adventure, humor, romance, and the early stages of war. The title for the film comes from the Bible. Tom tells Gusto that he says this short prayer whenever he takes a plane up. It comes from Song of Solomon, Verse 2:13b: ""Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.""Here are some favorite lines from this film.Augusta Nash, ""That's an awful lot of l'amour."" Tom Martin, ""I was in jail for a long time.""Gusto Nash, ""Oh, I wasn't expecting you."" Mr. Phillips, ""Who the heck were you expecting, Jack the Ripper?""Tom Martin, ""Ever notice how these European trains always smell of Eau de Cologne and hard-boiled eggs?""Gusto Nash, ""Thomas Martin, you're crazy."" Tom Martin, ""Crazy? How?"" Gusto Nash, ""Running after me."" Tom Martin, ""I'm not running after you. Just happen to be going over the same track, in the same train, in the same direction.""Gusto Nash, ""Don't you think we'd better get back to the inn? What will they think?"" Tom Martin, ""Oh, nothing. It's a French inn.""Gusto Nash, ""We hid in the clouds - a sanctuary of whipped cream."" Tom Marti, ""Is that the sort of stuff you write, Augusta?""Tom Martin, ""Same hair, same cheek bones. Just what I said -- precisely my type."" Gusto Nash, ""Listen, honey, after 10 months in jail, anything would be your type - a St. Bernard.""Gusto Nash, ""L'amour."" Tom Martin, ""All right, l'amour. I'm devoting my first evening to it. And my second, my third and my fourth.""Gusto Nash, ""You know, when we were in that plane, I had a hunch you were a stinker. Now I'm sure of it.""Gusto Nash, dancing with Tom, ""Say, you're not bad at all"". Tom Martin, ""Yeah? Wait'll I hit an air pocket.""Gusto Nash, ""Are they after us?"" Tom Martin, ""They're not looking for bird nests.""Gusto Nash, ""Thomas Martin - what was that middle name of yours?"" Tom Martin, ""Thomas Fuller Martin, also known as Thomas Fulla Malarky."" Gusto Nash, ""I'll bet.""Tom Martin, ""Yeah, when was it? Only yesterday we thought we could throw two people overboard, with their ambitions, their big dreams."" Gusto Nash, ""God knew better. He threw us right back after them"". Martin, ""Yeah!""",2,2,True
tt0032220,Arise and Shine,7.0,"An unusually constructed film which starts off like a screwball comedy albeit to the backdrop of both the recently-ended Spanish Civil War and newly-begun Second World War and finishes up as an interventionist call-to-arms against the global threat of Nazism.I think it works, aided naturally by the writing of the justly celebrated screenwriting partnership of Wilder and Brackett, capable direction of Mitchell Leisen and especially the on-screen chemistry of the emerging Ray Milland and the established Claudette Colbert. You can almost picture the censor of the day's pencil hovering over some of the early scenes in the movie as they coyly play cat-and-mouse with one another, in particular one risqué exchange between the two stars with a double bed prominently featured in the background.Walter Abel as Colbert's end-of-his-tether editor is rather clichéd but largely speaking, the parts of the lesser characters, such as Milland's two pilot chums and the hotel maid with family caught up in the confusion which add some shade and light to the main characters' motivations are well selected and portrayed.I particularly appreciated the topicality of the depiction of very recent real-life events such as the sinking by German submarines of the cruise-liner Athenian taking Milland and Colbert back to the States and the montage of succeeding newspaper headlines documenting the at-the-time seemingly unstoppable march of the German Army.Colbert later named this as her favourite of all her movies and I doubt that's just because the film ended up on the right side of history. It manages that tricky balancing act between comedy and drama in a contemporary setting and still finds room for an eloquent wake-up call to the rest of the world at its time of greatest need.",1,1,False
tt0032220,Claudette Colbert's Personal Favorite Role and Best Story Oscar,8.0,"It usually takes well over a year for a major Hollywood movie to be made from inception to its release. That's why November 1940's ""Arise, My Love"" is so fascinating by its inclusion of events overseas into the second year of World War Two. Scriptwriters Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett furiously banged out revised scripts on their typewriters in an effort to keep up with the headlines by the time the editing phase wrapped, with Paramount Pictures releasing the motion picture shortly afterwards.So hurried was the production director Mitchell Leisen had one last scene to finish on the last scheduled day. Aware actress Claudette Colbert had a strict clause in her contract stipulating her work day ended at 6 p.m., Leisen said he could wait the following day to film her lengthy monologue. Mitchell remembered, ""I suggested we break for the day and try it again in the morning. She said, 'No, I'm not going to let this lick me.' We kept taking it over and over. It was nearly midnight and she was wringing wet before we finished, but she was satisfied that she had given it everything she had.""Germany had overrun France as well as the Dutch countries in the first year of WW2, and were bombing the heck out of England in the autumn of 1940. ""Arise, My Love"" was one of the first Hollywood films to detail the events of the war's initial year, including the first English ship to be sunk by Germany, the sinking of the SS Athenia, as well as the German's invasion of France and the subsequent armistice between the two countries. The movie also detailed the opening stages of the Battle of Britain, focusing on American pilot Tom Martin (Ray Milland). His backstory shows him facing a firing squad for his role in the Spanish Civil War when he's told at the last minute his wife has been granted a pardon for him. Unmarried Martin discovers his supposed wife is newspaper reporter August ""Gusto"" Nash (Claudette Colbert). Her purpose is to get a first-hand story of the war and his exploits. They high-tale out of the prison before their deception is uncovered. This kicks off a wild romance as Martin joins the RAF while Gusto reports on the events in France.The Wilder/Brackett script is based on two components: the true story of Harold Dahl, a mercenary fighter pilot in Spain's Civil War, who was saved by his singer wife, Edith Rogers. She had appealed to Nationalist general Fransisco Franco to spare her husband and free him, which the Spanish leader did. The portrayal of Gusto Nash is patterned after news correspondent Martha Gellhorn, a correspondent reporting on both the Spanish Civil War and WW2. She married writer Ernest Hemingway the same month ""Arise, My Love"" was released.Ray Milland's life paralleled that of the fictitious Tom Martin, who, in the movie, broke his hand in the middle of a dog-fight in the air, forcing him to return to the United States to serve as a pilot trainer. Years earlier Milland was operating a circular saw in a shed in back of his house when his hand slipped, cutting off part of his thumb and severing tendons. He volunteered for the U. S. Army Air Corps, but failed in his ambition to be a combat pilot because of his impaired hand. He did take up the service's offer as a civilian flight instructor for the Army during WW2.""Arise, My Love"" was Claudette Colbert's personal favorite role of hers. The WW2 movie won the Academy Award for Best Story (Benjamin Glazer and Hans Szekely), while composer Victor Young was nominated for Best Musical Score, and Charles Land for Best Cinematography while it was a Best Art Direction nominee .",0,0,False
tt0032220,Falling in love in January. Will she miserable by September?,7.0,"While I found Claudette Colbert in this too forcefully cutesy, every now and then her character shows the strength that women everywhere would soon have to learn as war would take their men away and put women in control of society. She's a frivolous journalist who wants to write better articles, and indeed if there was going to be a female version of Joel McCrea in ""Foreign Correspondent"", her character would be it.Certainly she's remarkable as she rescues handsome pilot Ray Milland from being executed during the post days of the Spanish revolution. Their escape and flight while being chased by his enemies is quite riveting. Unfortunately the film then takes a romantic twist but not a good way into squeaky sappiness, and the overall impact of the film is slightly damaged.Dealing with the fall of Paris during its last quarter and spinning to pre-war propaganda, this improves a bit, and Walter Abel as Colbert's boss is quite amusing. Dennis O'Keefe and Dick Purcell are the epitome of the macho American male, and character actor George Zucco gets a good laugh as the Spanish prison warden screaming for the phone, only to be reminded that he's holding it.Decent writing by the not yet directing Billy Wilder, his words guided by Mitchell Leissen, who had just finished directing Preston Sturges' script of ""Remember the Night"".

tt0032349,Astonishingly Bad,6.0,"Hysterical anti-commie propaganda.  A loony and implausible plot.  A howlingly bad performance by Hedy Lamarr, trying to do a Garbo-as-Ninotchka impression, though sounding more like a particularly inept porn star monotoning through her lame dialogue.  Clark Gable is stiff and goofy as ever, though still strangely charming as ever.  He hasn't an ounce of chemistry with Hedy Lamarr, though it would be hard for anyone to make sparks with that sack of wet--though beautiful--cement.  There are a few genuinely and intentionally hilarious moments.  The tank chase was classic.I should probably rate this film a 4/10, because that's honestly about what it deserves.  But it was so ludicrous, so breathtaking in its absurdity, it made for oddly compelling viewing.  Kudos to King Vidor for allowing this film to be bad, because it would have been horrible if he'd tried to make it good, given the raw materials he had to work with.6/10",7,40,False
tt0032349,"Rivalries in a Communist ""Utopia""",8.0,"Ernst Lubtisch's classic comic statement about Communist Russia, NINOTCHKA, came out in 1939. Whether it ""influenced"" the production (also by MGM) of COMRADE X or not I could not say. Certainly there are similarities between the comedies. Lubitsch set his comedy in Paris, where a Communist trade mission is living it up, being corrupted by an émigré Russian noble (Melvin Douglas) so he can try to retrieve jewelry that the trade mission is using as collateral. The Russian government does not trust the three men sent, so they send a fiercer ideologue (Greta Garbo in the title role) who starts straightening out the mission, until she falls for Douglas's charm. In the end she is lured back (with her three associates) to the west and away from the Soviet paradise.NINOTCHKA had Felix Bressart and Sig Ruman in the cast as two of the members of the trade mission. Comments on this thread point out that in the 1930s ""accents"" were fairly interchangeable in Hollywood, so that the Swedish Garbo (and later the Austrian Lamarr) became Russian. So did German Ruman and German - Jewish Bressart (who would also play a Hungarian in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER).Unlike NINOTCHKA, COMRADE X is set inside that nightmare land, Stalinist Russia. Somebody is sending out unofficial (but thoroughly correct) news stories showing the crimes being committed in Russian by the government against the people (i.e. the purges), as well as the idiotic projects and waste mismanagement illustrative of how poorly the government is as effective government. This is being resented by the Presidium, who is represented by Oscar Homlolka (Commissar Vasiliev). Please note that Homolka's make-up makes him look a tremendous bit like one Joseph Stalin. At a public funeral covered by the press court, someone tries to shoot Vasiliev (who does all he can to hide the assassination plot). Mac Thompson (Clark Gable), the American reporter, manages to snap a photo of an odd site - a bearded man who a moment before the shooting opened up the lid of the coffin and popped out. This bearded gentlemen turns out to be one Michael Bastakoff (Vladimir Sokoloff), a rival of Vasiliev for power. He is made to look a tremendous bit like one Leon Trotsky.Get the message from Hollywood here? Vasiliev's agents have been trying to pin down the news leaks, and has narrowed it to two figures: Thompson, and one Emil Von Hofer (Sig Ruman) who is the news representative from Nazi Germany. Ruman manages to demonstrate it ain't him, so (despite Gable's breezy denials) Vasiliev believes it is the American.Gable has a close friend in Moscow, one Ygor Yahupitz (Felix Bressart) who is his sometimes valet. Ygor's daughter is Galubcha (Hedy Lamarr) who is a streetcar operator. Ygor wants Gable to try to smuggle Galubcha out of the Soviet Union into the U.S. And the film shows (among other things, including overcoming Galubcha's fierce belief in the Communist ideal) Gable eventually saving both the girl and her father.The comedy is quite amusing, even if it lacks the style and grace of the Lubitsch touch of the first film. But it certainly comments on the atmosphere within Russia in a way that NINOTCHKA failed to do so. The centering of the comedy in Moscow, the suggestiveness of a Stalin - Trotsky rivalry clone, and the heavy control over information is certainly more realistic than Douglas' being elegant and eloquent about the beauties of Paris.One more thing to keep in mind is a scandal which is on target with this film, and which (in 1940) finally began to raise eyebrows. In the early 1930s the New York Times had a reporter named Walter Duranty in Moscow. He turned out to be a fantastically well informed reporter in the Soviet Union, and came out with interviews and articles that were tremendously informative. In fact, he would win the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from Moscow. But as time passed, Duranty's methods and sources were heavily questioned. He also tended to take an official line about the Purge Trials (i.e., that Bukhanin, Radek, Zinoviev, Tuchochevsky, and the other hundreds and thousands of victims were all actual traitors against the Stalinist regime). After the signing of the non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939, the Times became very suspicious of Duranty, and replaced him. The quality of the articles became very much more even handed. Duranty was later revealed to be a Stalinist agent. Interestingly enough, the Pulitzer Committee has repeatedly rejected requests to take back their award from Duranty's heirs as his work was pure propaganda. So the issue about the control over the news from Russia was very, very real.",33,38,False
tt0032349,Purging as we go,9.0,"With the success MGM had with Ninotchka another lampooning of the Soviet Union seemed a natural. So the following year while the Hitler-Stalin pact was still active, MGM came up with Comrade X.Comrade X is a pseudonym for some journalist who is sending uncensored stories out about the real Soviet Union. It happens to be Clark Gable and the whole Soviet secret police apparatus is after him.But a valet at a hotel where the foreign correspondents stay played by Felix Bressart comes upon his secret. He offers a deal to Gable, he won't turn him in if Gable convinces Bressart's daughter Hedy Lamarr to leave the Soviet Union with him and come to America.Easier said than done because Lamarr is as committed a Communist as Greta Garbo was in Ninotchka. So like Melvyn Douglas in Ninotchka, Gable's got his work cut out for him.Comrade X's humor is a little more broad than Ninotchka's was. It even got a few good knocks in on Nazi Germany with Sig Ruman playing a German correspondent. The humor about the Soviets concerns what a dangerous thing it was to rise in the ranks of the party. Remember this was also the time of Stalin purging all kinds of people out of the party. Something that didn't stop until Hitler broke the non-aggression pact in 1941.And Hedy Lamarr is sure no Garbo, but she acquits herself nicely in the role of the fuzzy headed idealist. Gable, Lamarr, and Bressart get caught up in the internal politics of the Soviet Union and have to flee the country. What happens to them is the balance of the film and it is hilarious.One of the best films done by both of the stars. Grand comedy.",32,35,False

Here, Hedy is supposed to be Russian, and with a light touch, too. She makes a charming foil to beefy Clark Gable, who plays his usual role as the macho-male with a wink in his eye covering a heart of gold. Their chemistry is not quite as magical as that in ""It Happened One Night,"" with Claudette Colbert (who had the softer edge and mysterious sex appeal that truly complemented Gable's), or even his pairings with the brassy blonde with the Brooklyn accent, but there are a number of scenes in this farce that I have not seen equalled elsewhere: namely the escape scene in the Soviet tank. Before the age of graphic simulation, the prop men really had to come up with a phalanx of Soviet-style tanks -- unless they used miniatures, and to see them ""chase"" Gable, with Hedy at the wheel, is almost on a par with a Chaplin or Keaton routine.

This really isn't meant as an insult, as I really liked this Clark Gable film once I stopped worrying about how ridiculous the plot was and just watched it for the pure sake of enjoyment. Trust me--if you think too much while watching this film, you'll probably get a headache! Clark is an American newspaper correspondent in the USSR in 1940. At this point in history just before the US entered WWII, the attitude in the US was was starting to turn against Nazi Germany and we still tended to laugh at the stupidity and backwardness of the Soviets. This was a BRIEF transition period, as all films made from 1942-1945 suddenly portrayed the USSR as our wonderful and loyal friend and the Russian people as decent and brave since they were now our allies! Well, none of that is evident here. The Soviet government was made up of stupid, ruthless evil men in this film (instead of the smart and ruthless evil men like real life). And, Clark's job was to easily outwit the government and smuggle out articles under the pen name of ""Comrad X""--decrying the evils of Communism.All is going well until a lowly hotel worker, Felix Bressart, announces to Clark that he knows he is Comrad X and will report him to the government unless he agrees to smuggle out his daughter (played by Hedy Lamarr). The problem is that Hedy is a dyed-in-the-wool Communist and supporter of Soviet expansion! So, Clark lies to her and tells her he wants to take her to America so she can convince everyone that the Soviet system is best! She soon realizes he's lying, but after her mentor, Bastakoff, tells her to marry him, she does (after only knowing him a few hours).The party Commissar Vasiliev (Oskar Homolka) in charge of the foreign press calls Clark in to his office just before Clark can escape to America. he has found Clark's hidden camera and thinks he might be Comrad X, so he has Clark, Hedy and Felix imprisoned. Soon, a hundred of so of Bastakoff's supporters are jailed with them and are soon executed. With only the three of them left, Clark decides to sell the Commissar information--that Bastakoff was behind an assassination attempt on Valiliev. But, when Clark is taken to see the commissar, he finds it is now Bastakoff! Vasiliev has met with an ""accident"" and Clark knows the same will happen to him and his new family unless they escape. So, he makes a deal with Bastakoff to give him an incriminating photo, but quickly dodges all of the Russian secret police, police and army with his wife and father-in-law! In the end, they sneak into a tank that's aboard a train headed for maneuvers. It turns out the tank is the general's tank and all the other tanks follow them--across the border into Romania! The Romanians run in terror thinking they've been invaded, but all is right in the end.If you think all this stuff is pretty familiar, think back one year to another MGM film, NINOTCHKA. In this film, Garbo plays almost the same role Hedy plays and the movies are extremely similar in tone. I would have to say that COMRAD X is more silly fun, but NINOTCHKA is definitely a much better film. See them both if you'd like--I did.",7,13,True

And ""Communists have ideas, but they found out you can't run a government with everybody running around having ideas"". That's actually pretty true, too!

Obviously, Louis B. Mayer hoped COMRADE X would do for Hedy what the other film did for Garbo's image--and to some extent, it did.It's not as sophisticated and witty as the Garbo film, but Hedy plays a dedicated Soviet woman who thinks that an American that she is attracted to (CLARK GABLE) shares the same philosophy. FELIX BRESSART is her scatterbrained father, EVE ARDEN is an American newspaper woman and SIG RUMAN is a loyal Nazi foreign correspondent in Russia who is just as confused as everyone else as to the identity of ""Comrade X"".It's a good role for Hedy, playing her role very much the way Cyd Charisse played the Russian gal in ""Silk Stockings"", and with a comic flair that she seldom exhibited in any of her MGM films, even the so-called comedies. Gable is more or less himself as the cynical newspaper man who ends up taking his bride (Lamarr) to America after they've had a few escapades that have the Soviet authorities chasing them all over the hillsides in tanks--the film's most amusing moments.One of the funniest performances comes from NATASHA LYTESS, as Olga, a secretary who tells Gable she's a spy.

In the short term, MGM's anti-Allies screed compelled what was then called ""The U.S. War Department"" to seize editorial control of EVERY American movie production company, dictating the minutest aspects of war-time film scripts with reams of red tape rules and regulations. In the long term, of course, MGM was relegated into becoming the tiny corner of Warner Bros. that it is Today. COMRADE X, unlike the famed home movie of Der Fuhrer's Videographer Leni Riefenstahl (TRIUMPH OF THE WILL) did NOT win a top Oscar (via the sort of rigged elections for which MGM itself was notorious), but like TRIUMPH it is deviously entertaining because Satan knows that you can trap more souls with honey than vinegar.

Eve Arden, in her usual delivery, is the saving grace, but it still feels forced. Thankfully Clark Gable shows up. If he isn't always his best when he's trying to be a comic actor (he's really funny when he's a straight actor with funny lines), he still brings the screen to life. In fact, as the movie continues an absurd (and not very well written) satire of the Soviet Union, Gable holds it in check by his nonchalance and usual earthy delivery.Of course, the Americans in Russia are the only sensible people there. It doesn't feel like a propaganda film, but the point of view is so limited (and one-sided) there isn't much balance. But it's a comedy, and director King Vidor is known for competance if not comic brilliance. Hedy Lamarr makes a stiff Russian with a terrible accent. (She was Austrian by birth.) The chemistry between Lamarr and Gable is comfortable but the writing holds it back. And there is the biggest mystery here—Ben Hecht was one of the writers, and he's normally a bright spot.So this has some good credentials but stumbles along, mostly because of obvious jokes that haven't worn well over the decades.",1,5,False

Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer wrote the screenplay for this one, which was directed and co- produced by King Vidor.Gable plays an American journalist, McKinley 'Mac' Thompson, in communist Russia who successfully, and secretly, gets his stories and photographs through the government censors. He's referred to as Comrade X, and obviously the Russians would like nothing more than to capture and execute him for these traitorous activities. Lamarr plays Golubka, aka Theodore Yahupitz, a 'cold' native and party idealist who's not only a streetcar conductor, but also the daughter of Mac's friendly, though seemingly clueless valet Vanya, aka Igor Yahupitz (Felix Bressart).Vanya discovers Mac's secret camera and true identity and, because he wants to protect his daughter from the instability inherent in the system during that time, he 'forces' him to agree to take Golubka out of the country for her own safety. Bressart and Sig Ruman, who plays a German journalist Emil Von Hofer, were both in Ninotchka (1939). Oskar Homolka plays Commissar Vasiliev, who's desperately trying to catch Comrade X while at the same time keep from being assassinated by others seeking a power grab. Eve Arden plays Jane Wilson, another American journalist, who'd had prior relations with Mac. Vladimir Sokoloff plays Michael Bastakoff, the underground communist leader that Golubka idolizes. Keye Luke appears uncredited as another journalist in the frustrated World Press corps.The comedy is not nearly as good as the aforementioned film and is much more screwball, in general, with fewer of its political jabs finding their target. Though both Gable and Lamarr are both as watchable as usual, there's no real chemistry between them even as he tries to 'crack' her cold committed demeanor.Natasha Lytess plays a silly Russian secretary, Olga Milanava, who gets drunk. Mac pretends to be a communist in order to convince Golubka to leave for the United States with him (e.g. to persuade Americans to join the party); the two even get married!The movie gets even more off track when Mac, Vanya and Golubka, escaping from Bastakoff who has now successfully replaced (executed) Commissar Vasiliev, find themselves in an elaborate, overlong and climactic, tank chase!",2,5,False

tt0032349,"Silly knockoff of previous year's ""Ninotchka""",5.0,"1940 was the year of Clark Gable-Hedy Lamarr films. I'm very surprised that no review I read mentioned that Hedy played an adulteress-minded gold digger to Gable in the previous MGM hit ""Boom Town"". Here, Hedy gets her first Hollywood crack at comedy: not really one of her fortes. I'm very surprised no review I read mentioned the slapstickish brawl she had with Gable on their wedding night, after Gable's friend,played by Eve Arden, unexpectedly entered their room and her conversation blew Gable's claim of being a communist sympathizer: Hedy being a dyed in the wool communist sympathizer. Incidentally, Eve Arden never got credit for being the strikingly beautiful woman she was, emphasis always being placed on her sarcastic wit. To me, she outshone Hedy in the beauty department, as well as the personality department, although it's tricky to objectively compare blondes and brunettes.Hedy was a good choice in playing a Russian communist, in that she still retained much of her Austrian accent, which could easily be construed as a mild Russian accent. Mostly, she plays it stiff, as a caricature of robotic, unemotional Russian communists, as imagined by many Westerners. However, she does engage in a number of kisses with Gable even very early in their relationship. Her father, played by the charismatic Felix Bressart, after discovering that his boss, Gable, is the infamous Comrade X, wanted by the secret police for transmitting unfavorable sketches of the communist world to the US, demands that Gable take his daughter(Hedy) out of Russia, fearing that she will soon be purged. .Hesitant, initially, Gable agrees to meet her at her job as a trolley operator. This eventually leads to an initial romance. Later, Hedy states that they will have to get married so that she can qualify to leave Russia. Initially hesitant, Gable agrees. Strangely, secret police come to their room and arrest the two, as well as Felix, who is suspected of being Comrade X. They spend a short time in prison, during which all the other prisoners, as devotes of the new commissar, are order by the commissar to be executed. After a talk between Gable and the commissar, the 3 are released, and get in a car. Strangely, they are followed and shot at by a car full of secret police, until they come upon a stopped train of tanks. Somehow, they enter a tank and hide there while the train travels to a maneuvers site near the Romanian border. Several military then are knocked unconscious as they descend into the tank. Incongruously, Hedy says that she was trained to operate this tank while in school!! Thus, when it's time for their tank to drive off, she does so perfectly. Strangely, the other tanks follow them. It turns out they picked the general's tank. He has a microphone through which he gives instructions to the other tanks via radio. Eventually, they come to the edge of a very high precipitous. Gable now is driving, and, unfortunately, puts the tank in forward, rather than reverse, and they descend the precipitous with a very jarring landing that should have killed or maimed them. The other tanks follow suit, and continue to follow them, including crossing the river that separates Russia from Romania. We see a newspaper headline: 'Russia invades Romania'. Gable says they will continue in the tank until they come upon the US consulate!! Next thing we know, they are at a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball game! Yes, the ending is much too truncated!! Hedy wanted to go to America to talk up communism. But, the film message is supposed to be that, instead, she is seduced by life in the capitalist US. We certainly could have used some more evidence of that, and less of the tank maneuvers!! ..........I forgot to mention Gable's famous phone-derived lie that Nazi Germany had just invaded Russia, set to become true less than one year later!If you especially want to see Gable and Hedy together in a silly comedy, go ahead and see this, at YouTube, for instance. Otherwise, I favor the later musical remake of ""Ninotchka"": ""Silk Stockings"", in which Cyd Charisse takes Hedy's place, and Fred Astaire is trying to convince her that 'the West is best'.",2,3,True

Of course all of the upper ranking Soviet officers are worried about being killed off in Stalin's Purge.King Vidor directed this fast-paced anti-communist comedy with a screenplay written by Ben Hecht.

It's very obviously in the vein of the previous year's Ninotchka, which is a far superior film. Lamarr is not particularly good. The script is not good, and Clark Gable has to deliver some really bad dialogue.The film also has an identity crisis.

The dialogue is Orwellian but with a twist, it's funny! King Vidor mixed in lots of near slapstick sequences to keep this from becoming a filmed play. And what sequences they are! Hedy Lamarr goes all out in two of them. Her rock 'em sock 'em robots bouts with Clark Gable are believable and hilarious. Likewise Gables' tossing of diminutive Natasha Lytess sounds very un PC but under Vidor's deft hand the action comes across as hysterical.Casting is near perfect. Eve Arden does her hard charging working girl routine as well as she ever did. She's given some great lines and never fails to deliver. Always a strong verbal counter puncher, Arden holds her own once again. Natasha Lytess makes the most of her all too few screen moments. Felix Bressart, on the other hand, is on screen a little too much. Once again he plays the European duffus. This time it's a Russian duffus. He does well with his role, but ends up looking like a third wheel too often. That's because two of MGM's greatest stars are often standing near by, Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr.We tend to forget what a fine physical actor Gable was. He moved with a purpose and wasn't shy about mixing it up in a scene. Vidor gets Gable to give all he's got in the physical scenes the writers give him more than wise crack lines he usually had to say for laughs. Again, Gable delivers. He looks like he's enjoying himself and we like watching him. You can roll your eyes when you read this, but I think this is Gable's best work at MGM.Gable, of course, had a very good reason to enjoy himself; Hedy Lamarr. Watch the off again on again kissing scene. Gable's having fun delivering lines between kisses where he gets to position her head. And Lamarr? Again, roll your eyes if you want, but to me this is her best performance on film. And she was never more beautiful. It's been said many times, but Hedy Lamarr was a stunningly attractive woman. In Comrade X she got good lines and great camera angles. She never needed more.The downside? The ending. The last fifteen minutes are silly and oddly unfulfilling even for a light comedy. Even with that, this is a good looking film with a script and cast that more than stands the test of time.",2,2,False
tt0032432,1% Inspiration And 99% Perspiration,6.0,"If anyone is looking for a factual account of the life of Thomas Alva Edison this ain't the film for you. In fact Edison the Man is the second film that MGM did on him. Young Tom Edison had come out before this one and Mickey Rooney played a boy's life version of him. At the conclusion of that film there was a preview that Edison the Man would be coming out soon starring Spencer Tracy.The widow Edison who was still alive at the time gave her personal stamp of approval on casting Spencer Tracy as her husband. Who wouldn't want his life's story portrayed by Tracy. But among the many things not shown was the fact that she was the second Mrs. Edison. The first Mrs. Edison, played by Rita Johnson in the film died in the 1880s and Edison married again the Gay Nineties. He had three children with each wife. So you can see a lot of the personal life has been left out.The film is told in flashback as an aged Edison is sitting at a banquet table listening to the toastmaster tell of his life. We only see about 10 years of it from the time he arrives in New York to when he proves the validity of the electric light by powering a section of New York.One of the great quotes from Edison is that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. Inventing the electric light was the result of trial and error running into the thousands of methods and that is the part of Edison graphically shown. Edison is always held up as the great example of the American success story. He was a man with little formal education at all who had ideas and the natural ability and will to see them through. It should always be remembered that Edison gained his fame during the Horatio Alger era. He was the living embodiment of those stories about the poor kid who succeeds through hard work. The part of Edison that's not so nice, his battles over patents with other inventors, his ruthlessness in business exploiting those patents, that all comes later. It would take a mini-series to really do his life justice.But I think Edison himself would have loved to see the way MGM handled his life in both films. He certainly would have seen himself as Spencer Tracy plays him, the wise benevolent man, with an iron perseverance.Just don't anyone doing serious research on Edison use this film as a guide to his life.",30,32,False

It seems like a large number of films, but it is really less than three percent of his movies. He also appeared in this film as the great inventor (over 1,000 patents) Thomas Alva Edison (1847 - 1931). In 1940 Edison was a national hero. Nobody was quite like him, although Alexander Graham Bell (soon to be subject of a film starring Don Ameche) was a figure of great interest too. So was Samuel Morse, inventor of the telegraph, and Eli Whitney, inventor of the Cotton Gin. However no films were made about them. There was a film with Fred MacMurray and Alice Faye about Robert Fulton and his steamboat, but none about the Wright brothers.Because of the period of history it was made in, film biography rarely was totally dispassionate. All Americans heroes were flawless, so all questions about Edison's stealing credit from assistants or other inventors was pushed aside (his involvement in the patent battles about the telephone is not mentioned). Nor were his flop inventions: pre-fabricated houses made of cement (actually a good idea, but ahead of it's time), the attempt to be the biggest gold ore refiner in the East (using huge machines to grind the ore out of rocks), the electric car motor. His bigoted feelings towards foreigners (Jews, rival inventors like Nicola Tesla) were not mentioned, nor was his rejection of the offer of a joint 1911 Nobel Prize for Physics (for the accidental discovery of the Edison Affect of carbonization in electricity) because he had to have it with Tesla for discovering alternating current. None of this is mentioned...only the string of great inventions he had a major hand in from 1868 to 1894.

He invested heavily in Direct Current (DC) technology; good for many applications, but not for the needed power and lighting applications Edison envisioned. No mention is made in the movie of Nikola Tesla. Edison invited him to the USA from Croatia to work in Edison's labs. Edison made him work from 10:30 am to 5:00 the next morning, seven days per week.

Westinghouse was ruthless as well, but he and Tesla got along, and secured the contract to supply generators at Niagara Falls.Films such as these are great to bring initial awareness.

tt0032432,Job Creator.,5.0,"Hollywood produced a number of biographical movies during the 1930s, mostly of scientists, entrepreneurs, and adventurers. The films stuck more or less closely to the historical facts. This particular example is a little bland. Thomas Alva Edison (1847 - 1931) was not an adventurer. He was an inventor, a kind of combination engineer and entrepreneur.Since Edison wasn't somebody like Henry Stanley, the African explorer that Spencer Tracy had played earlier, nobody gets shot and no one's head is wrenched off. The most dramatic moment occurs when Tracy, as Edison, is bent over his new electric light and the filament burns out. Tracy's face drops a little.Now, Edison's life was NOT entirely uninteresting but Hollywood must observe certain conventions. The man must be entirely honorable. There must be no ambiguity about that. And he must be guided by a vision almost divine in its generosity.We may have no mention of the fact that Edison married Mary when she was a girl of sixteen. Yum yum. And we may mention that he was a school drop out but not that he knew little of mathematics or theory, that he was a born tinkerer who scorned figuring things out ahead of time, in favor of a method of successive approximations. Edison must retain his good nature through the course of many failures and his workers must be devoted to him, so much so that they'll labor at their benches for nothing.We can't let it be known that he was a mean, stingy, dishonest son of a gun. ""One of Edison's assistants was Nikola Tesla. Tesla claimed that Edison had promised him $50,000 if he succeeded in making improvements to his DC generation plants. Several months later, when Tesla had finished the work and asked to be paid, he said that Edison replied, 'When you become a full-fledged American you will appreciate an American joke.' ""Tesla immediately resigned. With Tesla's salary of $18 per week, the payment would have amounted to over 53 years' pay and the amount was equal to the initial capital of the company. Another account states that Tesla resigned when he was refused a raise to $25 per week."" That quote is from Wikipedia, and other sources have promoted similar stories of Edison's cheapness. What he did, he did because it was of commercial value, and he took credit for work done by his employees. He was even involved in a corporate fight over who would get to install the circuitry in the first electric chair.All that is beside the movie's point, which is that the guy, however Dickensian he might have been, produced all sorts of stuff we take for granted today. And -- here's what gets me about Edison and all these other characters who were putting together electronic equipment -- nobody knew what electricity was. It was all done long before physicists like Millikan and Rutherford began to analyze the structure of the atom. They couldn't have dreamed that electricity was a stream of electrons jumping at the speed of light from one atom to the next through a conductor. The electron hadn't been discovered yet.I don't think of this as one of Spencer Tracy's more memorable movies. As in most other movies of its genre, he starts out with ten cents in his pocket and winds up being honored by the whole world. There's not that much in between for Tracy to sink his teeth into.

He does have his ambitions but there is no particular drama. It makes for a rather bland telling of this legendary life. They don't even mention Tesla's name. His rivals are reduced to nameless businessmen and other jealous scientists. It is somewhat interesting to see some of his inventions but it's not that informative. I don't see how this got nominated for writing. Spencer Tracy is perfect in creating a nice character. I don't know if that's Edison or not.",2,4,False
tt0032432,Felix Bressart shines,4.0,"Edison, the Man is so corny, it feels like the screenwriters learned a couple of trivia tidbits about his life-his Morse Code proposal and being hard of hearing-and then created a huge piece of fluff around them. That's probably exactly what they did, and they were rewarded with a nomination at the 1940 Oscar ceremony. ""I'm almost afraid to flip the switch,"" Spencer Tracy laments, after it's been hammered home to the audience that he's tried the lightbulb over 9,000 times. There's no suspense! ""Be careful with that,"" one of the workers warns young, impressionable, bumbling Gene Reynolds, before handing him something valuable and breakable. He starts up the stairs-do you think he's going to drop it? There's no suspense, because everything is so incredibly corny.The good news is the supporting cast. Spencer Tracy heads up the title role, but once again, he doesn't do anything but be Spencer Tracy. Edison should have been played by Paul Muni, the king of the putting on heavy makeup to play a historical figure. He was angry at Hollywood and was taking a break, otherwise I'm sure he would have played the part, and done it infinitely better. But back to the supporting cast: Felix Bressart, one of my favorite under-utilized character actors, is given a very meaty role as Spence's most prominently-featured engineer. This is one of his only roles where he doesn't play someone bumbling or silly, so it's worth sitting through Spence and the corny script to see Felix pulling out all the stops. Gene Lockhart plays Edison's adversary, Charles Coburn is Gene's partner, Henry Travers plays a helpful friend during Edison's start, Rita Johnson plays Mrs. Edison, and Lynne Overman plays the comic relief. You won't see a historically accurate movie, but you will see Spencer Tracy in heavy age makeup, which makes for a nice change.",2,4,False
tt0032432,"Like most bio-pics, it doesn't get everything right--but it is marvelously entertaining.",8.0,"I have probably seen more bio-pics than anyone you'll ever meet and so I obviously like this style film. BUT, at the same time, I am a retired history teacher and love to know the true stories behind the films--and often these movies and reality have little in common! In some other cases, there stories are close overall to the true characters and events BUT key elements have been changed or omitted--and such is the case with ""Edison the Man"". While generally sticking to the truth better than most bio-pics of the era, some parts of Edison's life were changed for a variety of reasons. In some cases, I understand, the movie COULD have been 6-8 hours long if it dealt in detail with all of Edison's most important inventions. Plus, in doing this, what about his private life? You just can't do it all in a two hour film! However, one odd omission occurred in the film that I think they should have addressed. Edison's young wife portrayed in the film didn't live that long--dying before age 30. Here, they appear to have been married a long time and no mention is made of his second wife nor the children from this marriage. It's odd, as the dying young wife could have infused the movie with a bit more pathos and drama. A few other incidents were compressed because of time and to heighten the drama--such as how the phonograph developed (it actually took some time and inventions by other folks following Edison's invention to prefect the device). But, despite these errors and omissions that crazed ex-history teachers might notice, the film IS very good. It achieves the goal of lionizing this important inventor (and ignores his foibles to do so) and is always interesting. Well worth seeing but I strongly recommend you read up on the man--he was much more complex and incredible than the character you see in the movie.By the way, despite what was said in the film, ostriches DON'T stick their heads in the ground--whether they are afraid or not. It's an old myth.",3,4,False

Taggart is the man who first gives Edison support when he fixes the office stock indicator and is rewarded with a job at Western Union. CHARLES COBURN, FELIX BRASSERT and GENE REYNOLDS lend sterling support.Tracy gives his usual credible performance as the determined inventor, although the opening scene tends to be on the corny side as it leads to an extensive flashback of his life.By keeping the obstacles in the path of several of Edison's most noteworthy inventions, the story has all of the required conflict guaranteed to hook the viewer from start to finish.",0,4,False

tt0032432,"""A minor invention every two weeks, a major invention every six months""",8.0,"The caption quote is what visitors to the Edison National Historic Site in New Jersey are told. For there is no question that Thomas Alva Edison, ""The Wizard of Menlo Park,"" was America's greatest inventor. His accomplishment of 1150 patents is truly astonishing when one takes into account the times when he lived. Most of his life was spent in the 19th century.Movie makers have always had an attraction for biographies. To name just a few of the many featured in motion pictures: Alexander the Great, Marco Polo, Columbus, Marie Antoinette, Kit Carson, Abraham Lincoln, Brigham Young, Louis Pasteur, Geronimo, Knute Rockne, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy. Of course it is difficult to cram a person's life into a two or even three-hour movie. Then again, the movies, for various reasons, are not too accurate with the facts. With ""Edison the Man"" we at least have an enjoyable representation that focuses much on Edison's earlier inventions. We still miss much, like the early death of Mrs. Edison (Mary Stilwell) at age 29, and Edison's second marriage two years later to Mina Miller. The real Edison had three children with the first marriage, and three with the second. But as the movie ends in 1882, the first Mrs. Edison was still alive. Then again, the real purpose of the movie is to make drama with the earlier inventions.The biography begins in 1929 when Thomas A. Edison was honored at a banquet for the Jubilee of light (1879-1929). He reflects on his long life – already exceeding 80 years – by thinking back to 1869, when relatively unknown at age 22 he had improved the stock market ticker. From his success he received $40,000 from General Powell (the actual amount was $10,000). With the payment Edison constructed his famous laboratories at Menlo Park, NJ. After much sweat he and his loyal associates invented the Quadruplex telegraph, the phonograph (1877), the electric light bulb (1879), and many others. It was the phonograph, the talking machine, which really brought the inventor into the public eye. The singular great accomplishment was the electric light bulb, along with the dynamo and electrification of Pearl St. in Manhattan on 4 September 1882. These achievements came after he found that one of his pseudo-supporters (Taggart) had a vested interest in the gaslight business. But Edison was determined to get the job done in the allotted six months. From time immemorial man had needed to use burning flames to produce light. Electric power remains safer (and more comfortable in the summer).To keep the movie within a reasonable time length (Edison's life from 1869 to 1882), some of the major inventions of the later 19th and early 20th centuries are quickly listed at movie's end. They include the fluoroscope (X-ray machine), ediphone (dictating machine), cement kiln, mimeograph, and motion pictures (kinetoscope, 1891). The last listing, ""talking pictures,"" is dubious at best as Edison was long deaf and preferred silent movies to talkies. Also, Spencer Tracy makes the great man to be more pleasant than he really was. For the real Edison was motivated by commercial success as much as his desire to improve man's lot.Spencer Tracy was such a marvelous actor that he would study about those he portrayed, especially Thomas A. Edison. He even visited his famous New Jersey Laboratories. The actor had already won the Academy Award in 1938 for his portrayal of Father Flanagan of Boys Town. Perhaps his best representation of Edison is demonstrating the man's personal drive to succeed in all of his endeavors, to push harder and harder, to combine inspiration (1%) with perspiration (99%). Look at his despair when he cannot keep up with the bills, then later his weary joy when Pearl Street lights up. Worth seeing.",1,2,True
tt0032432,Edison: The Rest of the Story,10.0,"EDISON, THE MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1940), directed by Clarence Brown, became Hollywood's second contribution into the life of one of America's greatest inventors, Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). Following the earlier release of YOUNG TOM EDISON (1940) starring Mickey Rooney, which covered the title character's boyhood years in Port Huron, Michigan, this second of a two-part biography covers the rest of the story of Edison's life from unknown inventor to historic figure. Rather than waiting a few years having Rooney coming of age to reprise his Edison role, this continuing story not only came a few months after its initial release, but one of the few sequels where none of the actors nor director (Norman Taurog) from the preceding film returns. The acting honor goes to Spencer Tracy in one of his more challenging film roles of his career. While it's logical for anyone who's seen both these films to make comparisons, it's easy to point out how EDISON, THE MAN is connected with the other through its underscoring of ""Sweet Genevieve"" in certain scenes; a reminder of Edison's slight trouble with his hearing; Edison's communication through the use of Morse Code by tapping on the pipes; and eating his favorite meal, apple pie and milk. Rather than starting off with the usual ""Forward"" reading to what's to be presented, it offers a written passage by Ralph Waldo Emerson that states: ""The true test of civilization is not the census, nor the size of cities, not the crops - no, but the kind of man the country turns out."" And now, on with the adult life of Thomas Edison. Getting down to basics from an original story by Dore Schary and Hugo Butler, the adult life of a great man begins with a golden jubilee of light (1879-1929) where 82-year-old Thomas Alva Edison (Spencer Tracy) is being interviewed by a couple of teenagers (Jay Ward and Anne Gillis) getting the facts for their school newspaper before attending the banquet in his honor at Independence Hall. As Edison sits at the table as the speaker tells about his life, he thinks back to the days of 1869 as a young man coming to New York City from Boston on an invitation from his friend and telegrapher, Bunt Cavatt (Lynne Overman) to come work for Ben Els (Henry Travers). Attempting to get James J. Taggart (Gene Lockhart) of Wall Street to finance him for his inventions, Edison gets support from General Powell (Charles Coburn), president of Western Union. After selling his invention, Edison, who earlier met Mary Stillwell (Rita Johnson), earns enough money to get married and open his own invention factory in Menlo Park, New Jersey (The reproduction of it is first rate set designing). Edison's marriage brings forth two children, but due to he working tirelessly on his many inventions, it nearly causes hardship on his marriage. After Powell dies, it appears Edison will face financial ruin, but with the confidence and loyalty of those working under him, he strives to work on the greatest invention of all time.Aside from Felix Bressart, Peter Godfrey, Milton Parsons, Byron Foulger, Grant Mitchell and Addison Richards leading fine support, Gene Reynolds, in small but worthy performance as Jimmy Price, a teenage runaway landing a job with Edison's middle-aged associates on various inventions. While one serious mistake nearly puts him on the downside, Tracy's Edison give him this great line as he gives him that's second chance, ""One thing about mistakes, they don't have to be permanent."" Rita Johnson's role as Mrs. Edison is a bit downplayed at times and offers little challenge to her performance.As cliché as movie biographies goes, EDISON, THE MAN ranks one of the best of its kind. Naturally historians might be discouraged with some inaccuracies or eliminations that took part in Edison's life, yet so much can only be disclosed without putting this motion picture past the two or three hour mark. The fact that Edison's second wife and more children are eliminated, the screenplay covers more on his struggles than personal life and achievements, namely that on the invention of the phonograph, dictating machine (Edison's first words, ""Mary had a little lamb ..."") and finally doing the impossible by lighting up New York City, the most detailed of all.One cannot help but notice similarities of Edison with Tracy's earlier portrayal of Father Flanagan taken from BOYS TOWN (1938) as one who doesn't let troubles discourage him. As Edison is said to be as one who would have been a great man even if he never invented anything, Tracy would have been a great actor even if he never won an Academy Award. Though Tracy did win two, he earned no nomination for this fine portrayal. Longer and a bit slower than YOUNG TOM EDISON, EDISON, THE MAN is unforgettable by any means, especially Tracy's exact likeness towards the real Edison, the old man.Regardless of minor flaws and/or factual errors (that's to be expected), EDISON, THE MAN is no disappointment.

tt0032432,Wonderful Tracy depiction of an American hero,7.0,"I had to chuckle when I read a couple of the other reviews here for the mentioning of Nikola Tesla. I remember as a teenager, my best friend idolized Tesla and was so negative about Edison. And, although MGM hired advisers from The Edison Institute and Thomas A. Edison, Inc. (of course, they may have had a perspective about Edison that was just a bit prejudiced in his favor), this movie does give unrealistic homage to Edison. But, that was exactly the intent of the film. To portray an American hero whose many inventions and business efforts helped transform America. It's as accurate as the typical movie bio-pic of the era, but those of us who live today cannot quite imagine how Edison and his inventions captured the American spirit.The first amazing thing about this film is in the opening and closing scenes where Tracy (with makeup) resembles the elderly Edison to an extent that is amazing.Tracy had a remarkable range, and this picture reminds me of his performance in the two Boys Town movies, while during the same time period he played quite different roles in ""Northwest Passage"" and ""Boom Town"". I can't think of an actor of that era (or this) who was more perfect for the role of Edison.Rita Johnson is good here as Edison's wife. A tragedy led to the virtual end of her career. Charles Coburn has an all too short role as an investor, and Gene Lockhart is very good as one of Edison's competitors. A number of fine character actors portray Edison's assistants, including Felix Bressart and Henry Travers.The plot of the story simply follows some of Edison's inventions, with the most attention being given to his light bulb. The story is particularly inaccurate in terms of his family life -- he was married twice (only once in the movie) and had quite a few more children than the movie depicted. But the topic of the movie is Edison, the hero. And in that it accomplishes its goals.Highly recommended, and it's certainly found a place on my DVD shelf.",1,2,True

The movie starts with the elderly Edison(with a nice set of makeup) being honored for his invention of the lightbulb, and then the story goes back to his early days before his first major invention. He was already twiddling with telegraph machines at this point, so we don't really get to see where his motivation came from -- just that he liked to do this. He is personally very ambitious from the beginning and knows that he has to have funds to do what he wants, so he stalks one of the richest men in town for his attention. He gets it after fixing one of his machines and he is hired and is given the space and time to create. He and his ragtag group start putting together quite a few accomplishments to the point where they have their own building and steady workforce. He's shown as having a good comraderie with his close knit fellows but has to let them go when things get rough. At least until the lightbulb is created, then things explode. I'm sure this story isn't 100% true when it comes to Edison as a person, but they do make good entertainment with it. Tracy also gives a good performance and is given a couple of nice speeches(that obviously come from the real Edison). Overall, this is light family entertainment, good for everyone, with an educational message. This doesn't happen often in the movies and MGM did well with this one as the usually did in this era.",1,2,False

The Clarence Brown-directed film begins with Edison as an old man looking back on his life as he's talking to kids from a school newspaper.Edison had a brilliant mind and invented many things, including conducting something like 2,000 experiments before he found a way to get a light bulb to work. One of his inventions was the ""talking machine,"" and if you go on wikipedia.com, you can actually hear Edison speaking into it. This is my favorite part of the film - I worked on a dictaphone machine back in the '70s that looked like a smaller version of what Edison invents in the movie. The transcriber placed a blue belt with grids in it on a roller, and, as the belt moved, you transcribed. It seems so archaic 30 years later.The film is fairly inaccurate concerning Edison's private life and other details, but hopefully, it's interesting enough that it will inspire the viewer to read all about this remarkable man, well played by Spencer Tracy.

tt0032432,The great Spencer Tracy as the great Thomas Edison tells the great story of the great man and great inventor.,7.0,"Edison, The Man (1940) :;Brief Review -The great Spencer Tracy as the great Thomas Edison tells the great story of the great man and great inventor. Thomas Alva Edison, the name which needs no introduction. We usually use it as an example to inspire people because we all know that his achievements are truly unmatchable. So many sleepless he had, just to invent those instruments which have made our lives easy and accessible. He didn't sleep for nights to invent that Bulb, under which we sleep peacefully. But do we know his real struggle? Did we know that the greatest inventor on the earth who invented so many devices lived most of his life as a penniless person? Did we know that while he was trying tirelessly to make mankind's future easy, some money minded fellas were against this revolution? Well, there are lots of things we don't know and 'Edison, The Man' surely makes you acknowledge most of those things, if not all. Unexpectedly, it's highly fictionalised but all for good. 82 year old inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Alva Edison is honored in 1929 and he reflects back on his sixty year career of scientific achievement. The film takes you to his younger days when he didn't have the money to pay for the luncheon he was supposed to buy for a lady. And what a lady he got. Extremely supportive and always there to stand with him. The same goes for the team which worked for him and this God-sort-of man deserved such people around him. Tracy plays Edison, who I think was nothing less than a God. His constant and permanent endeavour was to help mankind with the help of science and he just didn't limit himself to that, but he went to take care of those needy people too, even though he himself was broke. 'He, still would've been a great man', the speaker says. Spencer Tracy's performance and Clarence Brown's direction makes it a Must Watch despite few flaws, especially for science lovers (like me).RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",0,1,False
tt0032432,Balance Between Dynamos...,8.0,"This is great example of hagiography. Spencer Tracy makes a great Thomas Alva Edison and the story picks up from YOUNG TOM EDISON with him just this side of his dotage eating apple pie as in the earlier film and about to be feted for nearly sixty years of inventing new technology in the 20th Century. As he is about to be introduced we see him fondly recall his heyday as a young inventor strolling the streets of New York in search of a position.He finds there is always a position to be had for a man who can improve machinery. From there one thing leads to another new invention and before we know it we're with the Wizard of Menlo Park as he works on his latest project the electric light. This is all very interesting as we watch Edison juggle debts for requisitioned materials and a wife wanting to know when he is coming home as she is now with child. He assembles a very faithful team albeit Lewis Latimer is conspicuously absent as is a certain Nikola Tesla who did alright with alternating current. Fights over patent rights would have made for interesting highlights in suspense, but this version which continues extending the Horatio Alger story line is nonetheless inspiring and fit fodder for family viewing.Reading the reviewers fleshed out a lot about Thomas Edison that I did not know, but I was never credulous enough to think that The Wizard was spotless or without sin. This version of Edison's life is classic Golden Age of Hollywood, and besides, at this time our great inventor enjoyed the status of a National Hero something no one would dispute then or now. Probably the time is right for a more full bodied character presentation of this giant of innovation, but who can say that simply his trials with his various amazing inventions is not enough entertainment.The trial to defend establishing a grid for Public Lighting is exciting in its own right. The struggle to balance the energy transfer between two dynamos is also hair-raising and thrilling and makes for a great parting comment as the venerable old inventor accepts his award. This was a great vehicle to showcase the best of what Edison was about and I think watching Spencer Tracy march through the mists of time as the innovations and inventions roll by in montage makes you believe that we are moving onward and upward as the truth of technological progress marches on.On a personal note, I really would have liked to have seen Steve McQueen play the Wizard from Menlo Park, as his love of machines is well documented and observable in his films. There is plenty of room in the genre of Inventors for many more stories that highlight people attempting to improve life by creating new improvements and this would be a welcome relief from films about witty hit men and whores with hearts of gold. Perhaps next time there is an Edison biopic we'll see Latimer and Tesla in the mix as fully rounded characters and find out what Edison did to that elephant Topsy. We might also find out more about why he would not accept his Nobel Prize. A more fully rendered human Edison might win admiration for an entirely new age.",0,1,True
tt0032432,"A film lover's delight, it's a fictionalized biography featuring Spencer Tracy",7.0,"Directed by Clarence Brown, who received six unrewarded Best Director Academy Award nominations throughout his career, with a story by Hugo Butler and Dore Schary, who shared a Best Writing, Original Story Oscar nomination for their work on this one, with a screenplay by Bradbury Foote and Talbot Jennings, this above average biographical drama features Spencer Tracy in the title role as Thomas A. (Alva) Edison. Rita Johnson plays his wife, the former Mary Stillwell, and Lynne Overman plays a longtime friend from the inventor's days as a telegrapher, James J. Cavatt. The rest of the highly recognizable cast of prolific performers includes: Charles Coburn, Gene Lockhart, Henry Travers, Felix Bressart, Byron Foulger, Gene Reynolds, Grant Mitchell, and Paul Hurst. Additionally, Irving Bacon, Harlan Briggs, Jimmy Conlin, Frank Faylen, and Charles Lane are among those who appear uncredited.The story, told in flashback, begins with Edison (Tracy) arriving in New York to get a job working with someone he knows as a fellow telegraph operator, Cavatt (Overman) nicknamed Bunt. Unfortunately his friend is heading West for other opportunities, but Overman's Uncle Ben Els (Travers) is willing to let him take his nephew's job, helping him with cleaning up the building. Uncle Ben lives in the basement of a business establishment owned by Mr. Taggart (Lockhart), and eventually the tinkerer Edison gets past Taggart's secretary, Edwin Hall (Foulger), when a stock ticker device fails and the future inventor is able to fix it on the spot, to the relief of many anxious businessmen. One of those is an important official with Western Union, General Powell (Coburn), who is intrigued enough with Edison to give him a desk and a job in his laboratory. Edison has several ideas for a better stock ticking device, and many of the workman are assigned to assist him including Michael Simon (Bressart), who was going to be let go until Edison saved his job. While working there, Edison meets his future wife, Mary Stillwell (Johnson), who understands Morse code because she too is a telegrapher. Conlin plays a waiter on their lunch date. When Edison has finally got a device to replace Taggart's inferior stock ticker, Mary suggests that Tom wait until the businessman makes him an offer instead of telling him what he'd thought the invention was worth. In a gloriously amusing scene, Edison ends up getting a check for $40,000 from Powell, after which Taggart gloats that they were prepared to go as high as $60,000 before Edison says he'd have settled for $2,000!Edison and Mary get married and the inventor uses the money to build and open his own laboratory in Menlo Park, employing all those he'd worked with previously (and more?) under Taggart. Over a five year period, Mary gives birth to a daughter and then a son while Tom and his fellow technicians scrape by with a few other patents. But the business's bills far exceed its income such that Edison is near financial ruin. Uncle Ben and his nephew come for a visit just in time for Bunt to distract the Sheriff (Hurst) from serving his injunctions. Edison has a week to invent something in order to keep the business from going under. Uncle Ben suggests that he work on his incandescent light idea, and the inventor struggles with it non- stop for days while getting grouchy with Mary. But the deadline comes and goes because all of his employees decide to forgo their pay, deciding instead to keep working. Edison had tried to go to Taggart and General Powell for financial assistance, but the General was on his death bed and Taggart wanted too much control in return for a $100,000 investment. It's about this time that Edison begins helping someone who was working on something that the inventor thought was nothing, but this leads to his inventing the voice recording device (e.g. the phonograph). The success of this invention clears up the money woes such that Edison and his men are able to concentrate all their efforts on electric light (e.g. to replace gas), and he hires a young man wanderer that reminds him of himself, Jimmy Price (Reynolds). Before Edison gets too far with this particular problem, his friend Bunt is shown to tell the press prematurely that he'd solved it, which causes bad publicity against the inventor; Lane's character delivers one of these speeches.After Edison figures out that his incandescent light will only work in a vacuum, hence a glass bulb is needed and, after thousands of experiments, they discover the right material for a filament, the light bulb is invented. After perfecting other details, Edison proposes to light a district within the city free of charge to prove the overall worth of electric light. Naturally Taggart, who owns a lot of gas stock, uses his representative Shade (Mitchell) to make it harder on the inventor - an unrealistic (six month) deadline is proposed and then approved by the city council. However, Edison and his team work to make enough light bulbs, wire the district, and build two dynamos large enough to supply the required electricity and are just about ready a few hours before the deadline before another small detail, regulating the dynamos to work together, must be worked out. Of course, they succeeded in lighting a portion of New York, to the delight of everyone but Taggart. After a montage which lists Edison's other inventions and patents through the years, the story returns to ""present day"", 1929, on the golden (50 year) anniversary of light (the invention of the light bulb). The soft spoken aged Edison, at a banquet held in his honor, delivers a speech about the evolution of science, how it shouldn't be feared (as apparently it had) because if men can invent it, then they should be able to have the good enough sense to control it.",1,1,True

Somehow I understand why in real life he stopped believing in the meaning of Oscars, after this picture had only one nomination. And why he shouldn't?

tt0029284,"Tremendous fun, if not the sharpest screwball specimen.",8.0,"There are some lovely, touching and dryly amusing scenes in this film. Kanin and the scriptwriters manage to form a substantive, if occasionally gossamer light, whole out of the playing of fine leads and canny comic incidents. The basic story may be the oldest of chestnuts, but it is here embellished with some degree of incisiveness. Grant's scene by the pool with Dunne and Scott reaches a fine pitch of hilarity, and who can forget the impressionistic scene of Scott's diving coming into Grant's mind and being presented in miniature on-screen? That master player of light, witty material, Grant, is of course sublime, and I was surprised by Irene Dunne - who I had never previously seen in a lead film role. She was magnificently feline, as Pauline Kael says; dispensing slinky, fluttering phrases and quips, and making it clear what a laugh the character is having; she seems rather to be getting off on the entangled situation. The speech patterns are drolly created by Dunne; wonderful Southern hamming, or archetypal screwball dame quick-talk... Her warming, gadding-about voice is charms, along with deft facial acting; look at the ""Oh Bianca..."" scene at the hotel early on, where she sensuously reclines on a settee and gets Grant to pretend he is entering the room and kissing his new wife. Minxish mischief of the most heartwarming kind, aye...! Remarkable to think that Ms. Dunne was over forty when this was made. She has the bearing of many years younger and conveys an impressive vigour. One takes to her unconventional good looks; her slight awkwardness as a 'star' is amusingly alluded to, under the surface, in her son's dialogue late on; very poignant little moment, that. Like Rosalind Russell and Kate Hepburn, she is no textbook beauty, and it is her characterful playing conveys a winking, winning attractiveness. Why is it that we have so few similarly idiosyncratic actresses around today? All - or rather much - has to be homogenised; pop star product looks are apparently required, and conveyor-belted into mainstream films. Film is missing the enticing depths of real-life when it opts for the conformist teenage boy's supposed 'dream woman' - mass-media-fostered - over a greater variety of people and appearances, as one encounters in actual reality.The actor playing the world-weary, rather Robb Wilton-esquire magistrate ought to have been involved more than he was; an enjoyable turn, that would have been effectively woven deeper into the narrative. Randolph Scott amused slightly too, in his support role; a worthy foil. Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history. The insidious wryness seems completely blunted by the end, when the couple are finally reconciled. One may be charmed by the actors' performances, but it all starts to seem a bit indulgent, and the feeling grows that chances were missed.But really, one must be indulgent, critically; there is priceless stuff in this film's fibre, and while it fires not on all screwball-comedy cylinders, it is a very pleasant feature with glorious screen presences making (deceptively) light of life.",47,54,False
tt0029284,"""You're Not Allowed To Have Two Wives, You Know""",,"From the opening moments, when the big wooden doors part and usher us into a beautifully spare art deco courtroom with slanting shafts of sunlight enhancing the clean architectural lines, we know that this is going to be a deftly-made, elegant film.  What follows does not disappoint us.Attorney Nick Arden (Cary Grant) lost his wife Ellen in a shipwreck in the Pacific seven years ago.  He has now decided to have her declared officially dead, so that he will be free to marry Bianca (Gail Patrick). The irascible judge eventually accedes to both the declaration and the marriage, and the newly-weds set off for a honeymoon in Yosemite. Meanwhile, who should turn up at the Arden residence, very much alive, but the long-lost Ellen?  When she hears of the recent marriage, she heads straight for the honeymooners' hotel ...""My Favourite Wife"" is a fine example of those early Cary Grant farces, the ones in which he gawps with surprise, double-takes and mutters to himself as only he can.  Irene smoke-gets-in-your-eyes Dunn is great as Ellen, unveiling a hitherto unsuspected gift for witty comedy.  Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington come close to stealing the show as the Ardens' cute little kids.  Randolph Scott is interestingly cast as Steve Burkett, the muscle-bound Adonis who spent seven years on the desert island with Ellen.Some of the film's highlights are worth mentioning here, like the superimposition of Burkett performing gymnastic feats alongside Nick Arden's troubled face as he muses at his desk, conveying with economy the husband's jealous preoccupation.  It is unfair to give away a film's jokes, but one gag which lose nothing in the telling is Ellen's outfit at the Yosemite hotel.  She has been out of circulation for seven years, and she looks comically untrendy in her 1932 polkadots and lapels, and obtrusive hat. Watch for the derisive glances from the other hotel guests.Such a light, charming piece of entertainment is hard to fault, but the film does have some shortcomings.  Its central problem, which is not resolved, is what to do with Bianca.  She married Nick in good faith and has done nothing wrong, yet she is neglected by Nick.  Because there is no satisfactory way of dealing with her, she is simply dropped.  Ellen's return from a watery grave after all those years would be a news story of international importance, but instead she arrives home having hitched a ride in a truck.  Her entry into the country seems to have gone unannounced, even to her husband.  The scene in which she persuades a shoe store clerk to pose as 'Adam' in front of Nick has enormous comic potential, but is abandoned after a few seconds.  Nick's sleeping-in-the-attic scene is far too long for the humour it contains.However, the film is a pleasant and very amusing romp, and such weaknesses as it contains do not detract from its appeal.",39,46,False

The courtroom scenes with Grant and Granville Bates as the judge are superior, and Donald McBride as the hotel clerk is exceptional.

He's a lawyer and he's busy trying to work out all the ramifications of what's happened. I've thought about it for a while and I came to the conclusion that it's Grant's professional training that prevents him from just confessing to one and all what's happened. Where a lot of the laughs come in is Grant trying to avoid marital consummation with Patrick until he can work it out.Another factor comes into play when Grant learns that Dunne spent several years on the desert island with hunky Randolph Scott. Grant starts to feel a little less guilty then.The whole mess is dumped on the judge who originally declared Dunne legally dead, Granville Bates. His role as the judge gives him some of the best lines in My Favorite Wife.I do feel sorry for Gail Patrick though. Usually she plays a lot of bad girls and other women in movies. But she really is the wronged party here.Dunne and Grant worked well together in another marital comedy, The Awful Truth and they were just as bright in My Favorite Wife as they were in the first film.One interesting footnote it was a remake of this film Something's Gotta Give that Marilyn Monroe did not complete.

Leo McCarey's chaotic pace which made The Awful Truth so much fun is missed here, but Garson Kanin directs capably in his absence and the script and actors deliver enough good wit and chemistry to keep it all balanced out in the end.Cary Grant gets himself into an unwitting romantic pickle when he's confronted by his thought to be long dead wife on his honeymoon with his new bride. Hilarity ensues, as it does in every brilliant screwball comedy Grant was the star of, and there are some priceless moments along the way.As in The Awful Truth, Grant and Irene Dunne make a fetching and compatible screen couple. Dunne's comedic felinity and tendency to affect nutty stereotypes in order to get what she wants is better than Katharine Hepburn's imitation of her in Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story. Grant and Hepburn were terrific in their movies together too, and not taking anything away from Great Kate, but Grant and Dunne's chemistry was just that much better and it's a shame they never made more comedies together.Hilarious in-jokey scenes between Grant and Randolph Scott, and a near scene stealing turn by Granville Bates as The Judge round out a pretty funny flick. The Doris Day/James Garner remake ""Move Over, Darling"" is memorable in its own right and viewed right after this would make for a good video double-bill.",27,32,False
tt0029284,Why All The Lying In These 'Screwball Comedies?',4.0,"This had a very promising start to it and looked like it was going to be a winner but - once again, as was the custom of the day in films - the story gets bogged down with the key people telling lies and then having to cover up for them. If you enjoy that sort of thing, this is a great film, but I have gotten sick of that same storyline. I can't believe how many films of the '30s and '40s used it. Maybe it's just me, but I don't find it humorous. Even a nice cast like this with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in the leads, can't make a difference. Both of them, however, were very good comedians - and good actors in dramas, as well. I am sorry to see them caught up in another of these ""Screwball comedies,"" of which, as you can see, I am not of fan.",15,31,False
tt0029284,A Shakespearian masterpiece of farce.,9.0,"Garson Kanin's best films are so bright, fast and funny, and have been plundered by so many pallid, feel-good imitators, that it's easy to overlook how courageously critical they can be, of prevailing social norms, for instance, what society takes to be normal - 'natural' - about crucial concepts like family, gender, marriage etc.  In 'My Favorite wife', Kanin takes the idea that a particular social order is natural, and tears it apart, by putting civilisation on one side, nature on the other, and revealing that there's nothing remotely natural about civilisation, or our places in it; that these things are man-made, and so can be questioned, negotiated, even changed by man (or, as is more usual in Kanin's world, woman).'Wife' opens with an elaborate sequence showing the structure of civilisation at work in its most intrinsic form - the legal system.  The hero is a lawyer, and is trying to declare his missing first wife dead so he can marry another.  There are a few things we notice here: the judge is hilarious, a cantankerous old buffer, testy, capricious, and not at all rigorous, or even knowledgeable in his application of laws which, after all, structure people's lives, and which, we learn, are constantly overturned by the Court of Appeals, so that something that should be inviolable is shown to be provisional.  there is room for manoeuvre, but there is also room for corruption.More important for Kanin's purposes are two incidental details.  The wife has been missing for seven years, a fairy-tale or mythical number in a site of legal process, undermining its claims to ultimate, 'official' reality. The hero's name is Arden, which might remind us of Shakespeare's Forest ('As you like it'), and the spirit of play that will inform the film, with people assuming and discarding roles, putting on costumes, using props, putting on 'plays' or performances to deceive, enlighten or outmanoeuvre others. ;On one level, this warns us against accepting appearances in a civilised world that depends on appearances (all the talk about respectability); on another, it shows that certain roles - like being a mother, or husband - aren't God-given, but roles which have to be constantly rehearsed and refined.  Play can be subversive - the way Ellen Arden dresses up as a man, breaks up a marriage, or tries to conceal a possible adultery - but it is also seen as a necessary process of socialisation: the children learn to imitate their parents, as they theatrically make their lost mother 'perform' her confession.  They learn that society is fluid, not fixed; they also learn to lie. (the hero winds up in an Attic (as in Greek comedy), but that might be taking the analogy to far!)Hitchcock once said that he often used Cary Grant because he wanted to work against his established image.  But the figure of masculine immaturity and insecurity so richly realised in Roger O Thornhill ('North by Northwest') is already fully-formed here in a 'hero' who jumps at any chance to avoid making difficult decisions.  Kanin, like Hitchcock later, makes brilliant, ironic use of Grant's most famous previous roles: 'Topper', another story about a professional flustered by a 'ghost'; and, especially, 'Bringing up baby', not just in the comically ghastly leopardskin bathrobe his second wife buys him, but in the animal imagery used throughout (kids going to the zoo; Steve as Tarzan etc.), contrasting with his civilised world that is making him desperately unhappy, his identity and masculine certainty fragmenting. (knowledge that Grant used to live with Randolph Scott adds further comic potency to their scenes)  This conflict between Nick's civilisation and the 'natural' order is typically complicated - Nick clearly married Bianca for her sexual prowess; Ellen and Nick are compatible because of their intellectual superiority to everyone else (which gives a streak of cruelty to their games, and makes one feel genuinely sorry for BIanca).  'Wife' is a masterpiece of farce, of shared rooms, opening and shutting doors, frustrated sexuality, mixed identities - but what makes it a true classic are the flashes of whimsy - the Steve diving sequence that results in some the most bizarre, incongruous, and sidesplittingly funny visions ever seen on film.",21,31,False

Numerous movies have used it both for drama and for comedy, and in this case, the premise is adapted to the screwball comedy formula that was so popular for a time in the 1930s and 1940s.The story starts by slightly revising the usual setup, with Irene Dunne as the formerly shipwrecked spouse, Cary Grant as the husband who has since become involved with another woman (Gail Patrick), plus Randolph Scott as a wild card in the relationships. Practically every stage of the story is highly implausible (probably deliberately so) but amusing, and it is generally left to the cast to make things work, which they usually do.Grant usually seems quite at home in this kind of comedy, and he and Dunne work well together, depicting their characters' relationship with the kinds of intangibles that help make the whole scenario more believable. Patrick is always quite good as an elegantly icy rival to the heroine, and Scott also works well here in his role. Amongst the supporting cast, Granville Bates gets some very good moments as the grouchy judge.For as far-fetched as the scenario seems at times, it works pretty well. The cast is strong enough to carry the weight, and it would have been hard to improve upon their combination of talents. It doesn't have quite the depth of comic variety or the subtlety of implied commentary that the best screwball comedies have, but it's an entertaining movie worth seeing.",19,25,False

Too bad his character, the only remotely attractive one, is stuck with a lousy screenplay and two loser wives.Nothing against Gail Patrick, who exudes cool intelligence and can deliver a cynical remark like a brunette Eve Arden. Unfortunately, most of her roles are thankless, and none more so than this one. As Wife No. 2, she's pure plot device, manipulated to the needs of the story.But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.If you get stuck watching this, check out the score and the sound editing.

The playing is fine and there's some decent dialogue; the problem for me is that not only don't I relate to the characters, I actually feel hostility towards the leads! Both Nick and Ellen are self-centred, selfish, and manipulative – how someone can come back from a desert island thankfully saved after seven years and immediately become so devious, almost malevolent, I can't imagine. My difficulties are compounded by the treatment of Bianca - were she drawn as some sort of gorgon then she would be getting her comedy comeuppance, but she is in fact characterised as an innocent party stuck between the other two's unpleasant manoeuvring so that the treatment she suffers doesn't raise the expected smile.",17,22,False

It's funny alright (but never hilarious), and the acting from - and chemistry between - Irene Dunne and Cary Crant is exquisite as always.

Throughout the film three of the four main characters take their turn to behave despicably, yet the new wife - a woman who's merely unpleasant - is the villain of the piece; constantly the butt of jokes and fair game for ridicule even though she's done absolutely nothing to warrant it. At times it's like watching two spoilt brats from the Hamptons bullying their visiting second-cousin from the Bronx.The script is also strangely stunted, best witnessed in the scenes before the judge.

tt0029284,Too Long in the Bottle,5.0,"It has sometimes occurred to me that screen comedy may have a shorter shelf-life than serious drama, largely because our ideas about what is comic change more quickly than do our ideas about what is tragic, poignant, dramatic or exciting. Certainly, many comedies from the thirties and forties, including some that were highly regarded when first made, come across today as stale and dated. There are, of course, exceptions. Throughout his career Cary Grant was a fine exponent of romantic comedy, and two of his others from around this period, ""The Philadelphia Story"", made in the same year as ""My Favorite Wife"", and ""Bringing up Baby"" from two years earlier, are among those exceptions, fine vintage comedies which still keep their flavour more than sixty years later.""My Favorite Wife"", despite having the same star, is not in the same class. The film starts with Grant's character, Nick Arden, about to get married for the second time. The problem is that he is still married to his first wife Ellen, a photographer who disappeared seven years earlier while on an expedition and has never been seen since. The problem seems to have been solved when Nick persuades a Judge to declare Ellen legally dead, leaving him free to marry his new fiancée, Bianca. Ellen, however, is not dead at all, and has spent the last seven years marooned on a desert island. Rescued by a passing ship, she arrives back in America on the very day of Nick and Bianca's wedding. The film then explores the complications arising from this situation.One reason why the film has not lasted well is its sentimentality, something that typically ages very quickly. (Oscar Wilde's famous remark that a man must have a heart of stone to be able to read of the death of Little Nell without laughing was made within thirty years of Dickens's death). Grant's co-star in the two other films mentioned above was, of course, Katharine Hepburn, an actress who was always able to bring a touch of astringency to her comedies, preventing them from sliding into treacly sentiment. Irene Dunne was probably regarded in her own day as an actress of similar stature to Hepburn, but her performance in this film comes across as rather syrupy, particularly in the scenes with her children.It might be interesting to consider how a film on this theme might be made today. (I have not seen the 1960s remake ""Move Over Darling""). It would, of course, be more sexually explicit; in the actual film we never actually learn whether Nick's brief ""marriage"" to Bianca is ever consummated. One assumes that it is not, but the strict moral codes of the forties prevented the film-makers from being explicit on this point. We learn that Ellen was not alone on the desert island but had a companion, a young man named Stephen. This causes Nick some temporary jealousy, but Stephen hastens to assure everyone that nothing improper occurred between Ellen and himself during the seven years they were together. It is hard to imagine a modern film being quite so innocent.More importantly, a modern remake would probably correct one of the film's weaknesses, the imbalance between Nick's two wives. It is clear almost from the beginning that Ellen is his real love and that he will end up with her; Bianca is a minor figure, who can quite ruthlessly be pushed aside without anyone worrying. It would have been more interesting if the two had had equivalent status, with the question of who would eventually win the battle to be Nick's ""favorite wife"" left in the balance until the very end. (A modern film might even have had Bianca winning). There are amusing moments in this film, but these generally do not arise from the interactions between the main characters Nick, Ellen, Stephen and Bianca. They rather involve minor characters, such as the crusty and cantankerous old judge, who declares Ellen dead and is then persuaded to declare her alive again, or the creepy manager of the hotel where Nick and Bianca spend their ""honeymoon"", a man who continually invades his guests' privacy in his obsession with defending the respectability of his establishment. On the whole, however, the film does not hold up well today. If ""Bringing up Baby"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"" are fine vintage wines which have kept their flavour, ""My Favorite Wife"" is a wine of similar age but from a lesser vineyard which has been kept for too long in the bottle. 5/10",12,19,True
tt0029284,Screwed up Screwball,,"Writing a movie is first a matter of engineering a solution to the fact that viewers both know they are in a movie and at the same time want to be swept up in the narrative. Many solutions fall into the category of ""folding,"" a special study of mine. For about ten years, Hollywood experimented with the ""screwball"" fold.This solution is based on situations where an actor plays a character has to dissemble: an actor playing a character who is acting. The screwball version of this lets us in on the joke at the beginning and always involves a comic situation (usually with unexpected consequences). This gives the writer the ability to create a more abstract situation, as goofy as you wish.And it allows you freedom to build a brand around a contract actor, which was the main goal in those days. So here we have a rather mundane brick in the building of the Grant brand. He is involved in a game of avoiding reality with two women, and one of them (his first wife) feeds the game.Grant does his job well enough, though he wasn't yet at the impeccably tailored state. The problem is the vehicle is poorly written: the second woman isn't engaged in the screwball world (though the second man is). It would have been fixable: she could have overheard the kids talking about their misunderstanding of the insurance investigation and believed Grant was trying to kill her.These screwball things are hard to do. I think the genre burned out because you have to be more novel each time out. I see ""Charade"" as the culmination of the form: it is only partly screwball because we the audience is only let in on part of the comic dissembling.

If the plot sounds familiar, it's because it was remade over two decades later as ""Move Over, Darling"". Talk about 88 minutes badly spent! Cary Grant plays a spineless, weak willed dunce who doesn't have the guts to tell his new wife his old wife is back. Irene Dunne swings back and forth from charming and lovely to manipulative and shrewish and back again. Gail Patrick should have played the role as Grant's new wife in a bitchier manner. After all, this is the same actress who nearly stole the show from right under Carole Lombard in ""My Man Godfrey"" as the deliciously evil older sister. Instead, Gail's Bianca is rather pathetic, and you end up feeling sorry for her. Heck, in the scene where she punches Grant in the face, I found myself cheering instead muttering insults at her expense. Randolph Scott got a chuckle from me as Grant's health nut rival for Dunne's affection.

Randolph Scott does not appear in this movie by accident, or because he simply happened to be free. His relationship was so well-known that John Farrow cleverly points it out in a short subject about horse racing that he directed in the mid-1930s. Frankly, I don't like Grant, the man, either, but I particularly dislike Scott, who used to be my hero – but there's nothing worse than a feeling that you've been betrayed, and even worse, made a sucker of! You could argue that it is quite wrong to judge actors against the standards you would apply to anyone else. You have to make an exception for actors is the general rule. Why? Why should actors be excepted? The answer to this question generally is ""because they are special."" And why are people like Grant and Scott special? Because the army won't have anything to do with them either! Okay, let's put all that feeling of uneasiness aside and just judge the movie by what we see on the screen, and not by what happens after the director says, ""Cut!"" In this respect – just judging the movie by what we see on the screen – we are asked to believe that a reasonably young, extremely vigorous man and a healthy, sexy, very attractive woman lived together on a small, otherwise deserted tropical island for over seven years and never once had intercourse! Come on, fellas! That is surely the most ridiculous scenario I've ever heard in my life! It says much for the movie makers' skills that, despite all its drawbacks, the movie is still quite entertaining.

The Judge, after painfully dithering about – some people find this funny, I didn't – then agrees to marry Grant and Patrick, and they go off to their honeymoon. But what's thisfirst wife Irene Dunne returns home! She's not dead. She heads for the honeymoon hotel. What is everyone to do.?The cast are mainly good in this film. Cary Grant spars well with everybody, and especially with hotel clerk Donald MacBride. There are many funny scenes that include Grant's reaction in a hotel lift when he first sees Irene Dunne. He also has an amusing scene with Pedro de Cordoba (Dr Kohlmar) as he rifles through a wardrobe full of ladies clothes, explaining he is doing it for a friend, and ""he's waiting outside"". There is another amusing set-up with the story of Irene Dunne's male partner on the desert island – hunky Randolph Scott (Burkett). Dunne tries to pass off meek Chester Clute as the man she has innocently spent 7 years with to a knowing Cary Grant.However, whilst, the film is entertaining and is easy to watch, it peters out at the end once the action moves to the mountain home. It gets sentimental and silly, and the film could have been resolved in a far more satisfactory manner. We are left with a few questions regarding the plot, such as what has Gail Patrick done to deserve what has just happened? Is Randolph Scott a complete carrot-eating moron? And Irene Dunne is actually pretty awful considering that she is meant to love Cary Grant. The children are a bit irritating and Irene Dunne has an annoying episode where she puts on a Southern accent, but, despite all of that, this is a fun film.",10,13,False

Without going into spoilers, I'll just say that throughout this film, the characters behave in ways that make no sense apart from serving the ""wacky"" script. Moreover, Dunn's character does things that make her quite unlikable.""The Awful Truth"" is a vastly superior Grant/Dunn comedy which avoids the pitfalls I've listed above.",8,13,False

The twists are eye brow-raising and cleverly written, incorporated in an otherwise enchanting story.All in all? I wish they had written these characters more forthright. The comedic elements could still have worked, and it would not leave fans wondering how much of the dishonest elements should be associated with their favorite star? I like this, but cannot love it.

Gary Cooper is his usual tall in the saddle hero whose presence brings about a general righting of wrongs.Except that Mr. Goldwyn had the presence of mind to cast Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean, local head honcho of the area around Vinegarroon, Texas. With William Wyler directing Brennan etches an unforgettable film portrayal of a man who's both ruthless in enforcing his will on the territory and a likable sort of cuss once you get to know him.Brennan has one weakness, as the legends have it in the west, he's crushing out big time of famed English actress Lily Langtry. When Gary Cooper is brought into Brennan's courtroom which in off hours is also a saloon, a little quick thinking on his part upon seeing Langtry's portrait over the bar saves his life. Despite Cooper's friendship with the judge, he's also taken an interest in homesteader Fred Stone's daughter, Doris Davenport. It's inevitable that Cooper and Brennan come to a parting of the ways.Wyler who is not a director of westerns per se has directed a couple of good ones and this is one of them. There are some good action scenes here, there are some scenes laced with humor when Brennan is around, and the romance is nicely handled.Dana Andrews and Forrest Tucker got their first notice in The Westerner as well in small parts. But it's Brennan's show.Walter Brennan won his third Best Supporting Actor Oscar with this film.

Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean thoroughly deserved his Academy award though it beats me why he picked up a supporting Oscar instead of a full one. After all, his part is about as long as Gary Cooper's. That aside, Gregg Toland's photography is a gem and the dialog well ahead of its time. The best thing about it all, though, is Wyler's disciplined direction. Yes, some would argue that the film does not accurately reflect history, that Judge Roy Bean died much later and not in a shootout but frankly there is enough prejudice, malice, and quirky humor in this film for one to know outright that Wyler never intended it as a historical account but, rather, as a comment on the difficulties of bringing law to the West. Some of it might be dated but Brennan will startle you, Cooper is darned slick, and it will keep you riveted. Don't miss it!",40,42,False

So good in fact it almost made it into my list of top ten westerns. Everything about is top notch-the performances, the photography, the humour and the screenplay. It is only let down by the contrived ending. The fight scene between Cooper and Tucker is as realistic as you will see anywhere, and the scene where Cooper cuts off a lock of Davenports hair is erotically charged. Of course the two main plusses are the performances of Brennan and Cooper-each fills the frame with their presence even when they have no lines, and Brennans portrayal of Judge Roy Bean results in one of the more memorable characters in westerns.

It is obvious that someone in the studio saw potential in Walter Brennan to star in a major motion picture in which Brennan, who was normally cast in supporting roles, carries the movie.

But this is one of the top notch hay-consumers of all time, make no mistake.What can you say about Gary Cooper that has not already been voiced over and over. His beautifully understated acting style, the subtle twitches and raised eyebrows. His bearing. The way he sits a horse, as only someone who grew up on a Montana ranch can. The sure enough Western accent. Had he discovered the ear-pull yet, I didn't notice it in this one. Until watching this movie on a newly restored DVD tonight, I had not seen it in 20 years, and had come to think of it as more of a Walter Brennan movie. I was wrong. Brennan was there with all his fine tools, all right, and he royally deserved his best-supporting award, but that is what his role was. When it's a Gary Cooper movie, it's a Gary Cooper movie. Never having been a fan of High Noon, I had thought maybe Dallas or Vera Cruz were Coop's best westerns. But The Westerner gives us the definitive Gary Cooper.The movie is handsomely turned out in the sensuously luminous black and white cinematography, fluid editing and silky-smooth scene changes we have come to accept as standard for top studio productions of the late 'thirties, 'forties era, and every cinematic effect is enhanced by a stirring Dimitri Tiomin score. The sets and costumes are superb with a much more authentic look and feel for the old west than most westerns before or since. The clothes of both the men and women, both the cowboys and the farmers, the gun leather, and the buildings, are all unusually accurate to the time and place. Refreshingly, the heroine of our piece, sensitively and strongly played by the beautiful but obscure Doris Davenport, wears a long, feminine dress and uses a wagon for transportation, rather than wearing men's jeans and riding astraddle a horse with her Tangee lipstick blaring as we see in so many great and small westerns. All the other characters, both male and female, come off like real 19th century men and women, not products of the time in which the film was made. William Wyler's direction is virtually flawless with just the right blend of action, tension, and humor. But considering the acting talent, the cinematographers, lighting specialists, art directors, and other technical help any director in the awesomely efficient big studio systems of the time had available, maybe he just knew how to stay out of the way.",26,30,False
tt0033253,A Perfect Representation of the American Psyche in 1940,,"""The Westerner"" (1940): Directed by William Wyler, starring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennen. On one level, this is a classic tale of the Old West as it struggled through a transition of re-settlement. Depicted as such, it is a beautifully photographed, well acted, gritty, weird, funny, and emotional story. But, this film was also made in 1940. The Germans had begun their sweep across Europe, they were breaking treaties as fast as necessary, and non-militarized countries could not withstand the armed renegade country bent on following no rules but its own. To think that this was not on the minds of ""The Westerner's"" writers, directors, and audience, would be naïve. It's a perfect representation of current events in Europe, England, and America  as of 1940. (1941 would change that.) I found it fascinating from this perspective  watching it with something of the same gut level understanding that people in that time would have certainly felt. Cooper was the outsider who had no real attachments and wanted to remain isolated  keeping his freedom and avoiding entanglements. The town, run by despot Judge Roy Bean, made their own laws, convicted everyone in their way, and hung them without a second thought. The farmers were seen as an impediment to their expanding ideas which required more and more land and water. Cooper was drawn into the battle of ideologies, and attempted to become the ambassador aiming for peace, not war. He moved slowly, and lost the trust of everyone  until it was made very clear to him that the aggressors had no intention of honoring promises. It was time to take sides. It is PERFECT representation of that, and our (we, the Westerners), time.",22,27,False
tt0033253,Cooper in a duel with scene-stealing Brennan,,"This western film features several top elements that help make it a classic in its genre.  Director Wyler was regarded by many people as one of the all time greats.  Cinematographer Toland was also a well-respected presence in his field.  Producer Goldwyn was famed for his attention to quality.  (This trio had, in fact, just made ""Wuthering Heights together the year before.) Then, of course, there is the delightful (and Oscar-winning) presence of famed character actor Brennan as Judge Roy Bean.  This is not in any way discounting the work of Cooper who is highly effective and appealing here as well.  Cooper plays the title character, a drifter who has the unlucky prospect of having to appear before the notorious ""hangin' judge"" Brennan. Once his case is settled, he forms an uneasy alliance with Brennan, while also sticking around long enough to help damsel in distress Davenport. Before long, he's in the middle of a range war between cattle ranchers and farmers all being unfairly presided over by Brennan (who has an undue fascination with the actress Lily Langtry.)  Cooper is gorgeous in this film and gives a strong performance (despite his documented disinterest in it due to the knowledge that Brennan had the best part.)  Brennan predictably steals most every scene he's in in a part that is more co-starring than supporting.  Still, his rapport with Cooper is what gives his role meaning. Although riddled with what are now cliches, the script is full of neat touches between the two men.  It's not every day a viewer catches Gary Cooper waking up drunk in a twin bed with Walter Brennan's arm around him! This sequence (as well as one earlier when the two men square off over ""a drink"") is priceless.  There's also a memorable showdown in an opera house. Davenport makes a lovely, if unusual heroine (earthier and less slender than many leading ladies of her day.)  She would retire shortly after this film. Tucker will be almost unrecognizable to his fans from ""F Troop"" and other later works of his.  Andrews is given very little to do.  The film might have been better off with a more apt title as it's less the story of ""The Westerner"" than it is an observation of the relationship between these two men.",22,26,False

Doris Davenport was not much for the female lead, and one reason why her name is so unfamiliar.

Nobody can believe the first sequence in which Cooper escapes being hanged by the infamous Judge Roy Bean by making believe he is a friend of Lily Langtry. This could have worked, had Wyler treated the whole picture as a parody, which in a certain way it is. The climax, in the empty theater is still more unbelievable than the first sequence. I have read somewhere that Cooper did not want to make this picture, and it was Wyler that convinced him. The trouble is that Wyler does not appear to have been convinced himself, except in the dramatic even tragic sequences: the spectacular fire, for example. It is a pity that the charming Doris Davenport retired after three films; she showed promise in The Westerner. Anyhow, it has the wonderful photography one always expected from Gregg Toland, and is terrifically entertaining.",8,18,False

Cole then falls for damsel Jane Ellen (Doris Davenport) and stays in the area advocating for the rights of homesteaders ; Cole has to have an ending confrontation with the judge . With these characters, the film explores the misery and the greatness of the human condition. Gary Cooper was 39 years when he played in this movie and he was a very famous player . The film gave Cooper one of the best of his laconic , strong characters as the cowboy caught among opposing factions ; in other hand Walter Brennan composing the reply and gives a role of cruel judge but that is nice , capable at the same time, being brutal and relentlessly hanging whatever suspect . The film describes the institutional and administrative instability that prevails in wide zones of western border, underscores the friendship, companionship, honesty, sense of adventure, enterprise and justice sentence drills by unscrupulous and dishonest people.The narrative is vivid and vibrant.

Meanwhile tensions are running high between cattle ranchers and new settlers, crop farmers - ""Homesteaders"". This is a lopsided battle in that Bean tends to side with the ranchers.The basic plot seems interesting enough in that it focuses on an actual historic figure - Judge Roy Bean - and his brand of justice. Also, having seen the 1972 film 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean' (directed by John Huston and starring Paul Newman as the Judge), I was intrigued to see another take on the man.Not that Bean, played by Walter Brennan, is the main character. That honour goes to Cole Harden, played by the legendary Gary Cooper. Having legends like Cooper and Brennan in the movie, plus the fact that it is directed by William Wyler, made me think this this should be well worth the watch.Well, sort of, and no. Brennan is great as Bean and Cooper is okay as Harden. The initial few scenes are quite interesting, often funny, as we see Harden's clever manoeuvring of himself out of being hanged. However, from then on the plot becomes disjointed with many sub-plots that don't really go anywhere, a main plot that changes direction randomly, plus limited character depth and thus limited engagement. It all seems so start-stop and discontinuous.Interesting enough to keep me watching but overall it is reasonably disappointing.",10,15,False

Needless to say, both Cooper and Brennan are wonderful in the film and really turn this western into a near comic masterpiece. The opening scenes, when Cooper is on trial for his life, the way he and Brennan discuss Lily Langtry is pure genius from the acting and directing standpoint. The way the two actors play off each others lines and facial gestures makes for plenty of laugh out loud moments. Wyler's comic timing in the editing and directing is top notch and really makes this scene something beautiful to watch. Wyler's direction during the fire sequence is also top notch and makes for a rather suspenseful scene.

tt0033253,Subtly And Weakly We Plod Along,,"At first I couldn't figure out what the story's main conflict was. Then I went back and read the prologue: homesteaders vs. cattlemen. Oh. Maybe that was a big cultural rift back in the 19th century; but here in the 21st century, it seems a little too subtle. It also seems a little too weak as a premise to build a feature length story around. And so the relationship between Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan) and cowpoke Cole Harden (Gary Cooper) eclipses the main story line.Judge Bean's romantic obsession with Lily Langtry screams contrivance as a way to advance the script's weak plot. All that business with a lock of Miss Lily's hair just reeks of superfluous silliness. There's no organic story relationship between Miss Lily and the homesteaders. Were the scriptwriters grasping at corn straws? Further, the script is talky, and the plot plods along, slowly and all drawn-out.But with the exalted presence of Water Brennan, I suppose all is forgiven, or at least overlooked. And yet, even here, I find discontent. My mental image of Judge Bean is of an old man, hardened and tough. In this film, Brennan is anything but old. I would thus have preferred an older actor in the role, though in subsequent films Brennan is perfectly cast. And Gary Cooper plays his usual stiff, wooden self. Maybe his acting is just  subtle.If the script and the casting are imperfect, the film's dusty, indigent visuals convey a terrific look of 19th century authenticity, helped along by expansive B&W cinematography that captures a landscape that genuinely looks like the Trans Pecos of West Texas, where the story is set.The film's visuals thus save the film from being a complete dud.

tt0033253,"Fine, Professional Western.",7.0,"Walter Brennan, whose movie this is, is ""Judge"" Roy Bean, the ruler of the tiny frontier town of Vinagaroon, Texas. He's a hanging judge. Everybody that comes into his bar room cum court room is ""guilty"" and they are all hanged, whatever the offense. Brennan's character is one of those blustering military heroes -- William F. Halsey, George S. Patton, ""Howlin' Mad"" Smith. They are always angry and aggressive. They bark out orders. They brook no insubordination. And they usually have some humanizing weakness or quirk -- Halsey discomfort at getting injections, Patton's vanity, that sort of thing. Brennan fits the mold. His weakness is his adoration of the actress, Lilly Langtry. The difference between the arrogant military commanders and Brennan's character is that the commanders channel their prodigious self-confidence into socially approved acts, while Judge Roy Bean had no aspirations higher than maintaining his position as corrupt king of Vinagaroon, perfectly comfortable in his authoritarian skin.But Brennan's weakness humanizes him, too. We disapprove of his hanging people all the time and making up his ""rulings"" as he goes along to suit his own aggrandizement, but we can also empathize with his worship of a star of the theater whom he has little chance of meeting. He's like a murderous philatelist pining for a rare stamp.Gary Cooper is a minimalist actor, along the lines of Robert Redford, but he's very good at signaling what's going on in his head with only the slightest change of expression. He's accused of horse stealing in Vinagaroom and is about to be hanged. Then he divines Brennan's devotion and claims that he not only MET Lilly Langtry but has a lock of her hair stashed in El Paso. His sentence is forgotten and an accommodation arranged. It leads to a shoot out at the end in which Brennan dies, but not before he satisfies his life's desire and has a glimpse of Lilly Langtry.The movie's iconography gives the impression that it's just another Western actioner, but it isn't that. Oh, there's a dreary actress (Doris Davenport) to provide Cooper with a romantic interest, but William Wyler, the director, and Niven Busch, the writer, make full use of every tool at their disposal, including the supernumerary girl.I'll give just two brief examples of unusually good writing and direction. (1) Having promised Brennan to deliver a lock of Lilly Langtry's hair (which he never had), Cooper is compelled to bring back a fake. The only woman around is Davenport. Cooper and Davenport are leaning on a wooden fence and she is berating him for something or other, while he smiles smoothly, snipping carelessly at his buckskin fringe, and he delicately lifts a strand of her long hair, scissors poised. She stops talking and pouts. ""Can I take a little?"", asks Cooper. Then, a pause, and -- SNIP -- and she snaps out ""No!"", just a fraction of a second too late. It's not much, but it's an expression of some of the effort that went into the writing and direction. What I mean is -- somebody had to THINK about that little exchange in order to make it as humanly amusing as it is.Example two -- briefer. Cooper returns to Brennan with the promised lock of hair tucked away in a matchbox inside a tobacco pouch with a draw string. As the two men sit together, Cooper reaches inside his shirt. Wrong side. With the most deliberate of movements, he reaches into the other side of the shirt. Brennan, meanwhile, is bouncing up and down with anticipation, like a child about to see a Christmas present unwrapped. (It's all done without dialog.) Cooper finally, slowly, extracts the pouch and gently tries to pull it open. But the draw string is stuck and the pouch is intractable. Cooper tugs at it, tugs again -- and Brennan's tense, empty hands mimic Cooper's motions impatiently.An added bonus is one of the better ""next day"" scenes in the movies. Brennan and Cooper, two mutually wary, short-time friends, get blind drunk on a local whiskey that has the power to eat through the bar. Cooper wakes up the next morning to find himself in the same narrow cot as Brennan, and with the snoring Brennan's arm around him. Cooper clambers clumsily out of the bunk and when he nudges Brennan's arm, a hidden ace falls out of the sleeve.I can't go on because I'll run out of space and anyway I'm laughing too hard.

Unfortunately, she retired from the screen shortly after making this film but she certainly showed promise as an actress.As for GARY COOPER, he's at home in a role he could have played blind-folded by now and under William Wyler's direction gives another one of his warm and affable portrayals as a man who finds himself in the unusual predicament of having to justify himself before the very biased judge who has no sympathy for ranchers or homesteaders--and only reaches some kind of kinship with Cooper when they share a mutual admiration for actress Lily Langtry (a forgettable LILIAN BOND), about whom the judge is obsessed.Has some interesting action scenes in western tradition, but enjoyment of this one depends on how much of Walter Brennan you can take, since he monopolizes the screen most of the time with a bigger than life demonstration of his acting technique.Trivia note: DANA ANDREWS (whom Wyler would later entrust with a big role in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES) has a one-line bit part and FORREST TUCKER makes his screen debut as a man who fights Cooper.",6,12,False

Hackman and Brennan won Oscars. Wallach should have.Cooper looks great and acts with subtlety and clevernessCooper also contributes to the movie's very effective comic relief, much of it understated and visual.The whole movie looks great. I had a great print on the DVD I rented.Female lead was not gratuitous. She was a strong character and an active player in plot developments.Excellent Civil War references.Now here's what wasn't so great:I was bored to tears by the ""cattlemen versus homesteaders"" plot. It's always the same story with the same ending.As is typical in ""cattle"" Westerns, unless there is a trail drive, there is little opportunity for location shooting. This movie is strictly back lot.The romantic subplot was excruciatingly stiff and dated.Not a single Mexican or Indian reference in 1882 West Texas?

tt0033253,Gary Cooper as Scheherazade,6.0,"Walter Brennan stars as Judge Roy Bean, the legendary self appointed law west of the Pecos in Texas. He uses whoever happens to be in his saloon as a jury, and the penalty of death is often dispensed for killing or stealing the animals of others.At this time Cole Harden (Gary Cooper) is brought to the judge for stealing a horse. Cole claims he bought this horse, although he admits the person he bought it from may have stolen it from the original owner. The judge is not impressed, and he can tell neither is the jury. So while the jury deliberates, Cole makes conversation with the judge, figures out he is obsessed with British actress Lillie Langtry, and talks about the time he met her, and about the lock of her hair that he has back in El Paso. Then the jury comes back with the expected guilty verdict. The judge defers Cole's sentence until he can look into matters more, since he says that no friend of Lillie Langtry could be a horse thief. Plus Bean really wants to hear more of Cole's tales of meeting Lillie Langry, and he really wants to see that lock of hair. Later, luck would have it that the actual horse thief wanders into Judge Bean's bar. When Cole shows that he still has the sixty dollars that he paid for the horse on him, there is a shootout and Bean shoots the actual thief dead, freeing Cole.What I just described is the best part of the film. And I really haven't spoiled anything by telling you this since the art of it is in Brennan's and Cooper's delivery and the chemistry that they had together. But because an entire feature film is needed, there is a significant subplot about the judge being pro cattleman and thus backing people who sabotage the farming homesteaders nearby. This subplot is not that compelling and neither is the romance between Cooper's Cole and one of the daughters of the homesteaders, played by Doris Davenport. Davenport wasn't a very interesting actress, and she had only one other credited role the same year this film came out before leaving acting entirely.I'd say watch it for probably the best thing Walter Brennan ever did and the great chemistry he had with Gary Cooper, but that the rest of the film, when Cooper and Brennan are not interacting, can be a bit of a bore.",9,10,False

Instead of being a pure and innocent woman as in the original version, this Snow White is a nightclub singer with dubious associations to a known gangster.  Also, the character played by Gary Cooper is both Prince Charming and head dwarf rolled into one.;Feels more like a Billy Wilder film than a Howard Hawks feature.  This is because of certain characteristics throughout the story like its zanniness which is a fixture of Billy Wilder's comedies.  Also includes a satiric element so importantly featured in most of Billy Wilder's directorial work. Skillfully written by Billy Wilder, a filmmaker with a knack for creating humorous situations out of everyday life.;Ball of Fire(1941) is the major blue print for Billy Wilder's late 1950s comedy masterpiece, Some Like It Hot(1959).  It deals with someone who has to blend with a crowd she doesn't usually hang out with to avoid trouble which was the basic premise for Some Like It Hot(1959).  The plot for Ball of Fire(1941) where Sugarpuss O'Shea finds sanctuary in a male filled world is the perfect opposite of Some Like It Hot(1959) where the two male characters blend in a female dominated band.  Sugurpuss O'Shea and the two male characters of Some Like It Hot(1959) are involved in nightclub work though in different jobs.;Barbara Stanwyck is awe striking gorgeous for the part of Sugarpuss O'Shea. She belongs in a long line of beautiful and talented actressess who dazzles the big screen with presence in Howard Hawks films.  Barbara Stanwyck in this film is a sensuous kitten and tough thinking woman.  A warmup for Stanwyck's most sensual performance on film in Double Indemnity(1944).;No Howard Hawks motion picture(with few exceptions) goes through a story without including some kind of romantic chemistry and romantic conflict. Professor Potts and Sugarpuss O'Shea are opposites personality wise yet connect because of Potts naive but joyful look at life.  What wins Sugarpuss's heart is Professor Potts clumsy and gentle nature which is quite a contrast to her gangster boyfriend.  The romantic chemistry of the two lacks the hard-boiled edge of the Bogart-Bacall films by Howard Hawks which is a refreshing change here.;The classic screwball comedy that was extremely popular during the decades of the 1930s and 1940s.  Ball of Fire(1941) is part of Howard Hawks screwball comedy period when he contributed to the sub genre with comical and witty portrayals of everyday life.  Matches the rapid fire dialogue of His Girl Friday(1941) with the sultriness of The Big Sleep(1946).  Ball of Fire(1941) puts smiles on faces with priceless moments of laughter.;Sugarpuss O'Shea is a typically strong Hawks female character who overwheims the film's hero with her flamboyant manners.  The name Sugarpuss suggests something that is alluring and sweet.  The inspiration for the person of Sugarpuss O'Shea was Mistress of Bugsy Siegal, Virginia ""Sugar"" Hill. Sugarpuss O'Shea bar none is the most alluring female character in a Howard Hawks movie.;Well rounded performances are turned out by the majority of the cast.  The actors who play Professor Potts associates excell in their eccentric performances.  Nice for a change to see Gary Cooper play a person who is awkward, intellegent, and romantic.  Dan Duryea adds a touch of dry comic relief as a gangster thug.;Amusing to see six grown men behave in manners akin to an adolescent the minute Sugarpuss O'Shea walks into their lives.  The scenes where Professor Potts goes on the street to learn of some street slang to add to his and associates encyclopedia is a masterstroke in editing.  The moment near the end where Potts tells the gangster boyfriend of Sugarpuss to ""Put up your dukes"" is a hirilous moment in the film.  His Girl Friday(1940) is still the best screwball comedy Howard Hawks ever did but Ball of Fire(1941) is a close second.;Ball of Fire(1941) comprises of some fine cinematography by Gregg Toland whose creative eye lended a hand to the monumental camera work of Citizen Kane released during the same year.  Early in the nightclub scene is an uncredited cameo by Elisha Cook Jr.  Most of the time an excellent film is marked by excellent direction and Ball of Fire(1941) is no exception.

tt0033373,and featuring Gene Krupa and his orchestra!,9.0,"Ball of Fire is a real 'screwball' comedy, and it being directed by Howard Hawks, who made arguably the best one of all (His Girl Friday), ups the stakes just a bit. Not only that, but it was one of Billy Wilder's first projects on a screenplay, and his sharp wit comes through in almost every scene that needs it. And more than that, when the movie needs to be romantic, without any frills, it really is. At the center of the craziness that becomes the story (mostly towards the end and early on and a little in the middle) is a story that we know is formulaic- that a woman who is already attached (if not quite yet hitched) to someone else falls into an unlikely situation with another man and the two suddenly become really close, the man first and then the woman- but its the chemistry between a sexy pre-Double Indemnity Barbara Stanwyck with conservative Gary Cooper.If, ultimately, it doesn't have the machine-gun energy of His Girl Friday (then again, few movies do), it makes up for it with a fun premise that Hawks and Wilder ride out logically, as far as comedy premises can go. It's about seven professors and their leader professor, played by Cooper, who for years have been writing an encyclopedia and are coming close to the end... except for a snag - slang words. The old guys and intellectuals haven't a clue as to what words like ""Boogie"" and ""sugar-puss"" mean, until they get a few people off the street to tell them. That, and a nightclub singer (Stanwyck) on the run from the cops after she gets unwittingly (and unfairly) mixed up in a murder plot with her fiancée. So, she shacks up with Cooper and his fellow profs, and it becomes Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with the twist that the girl this time is a lot more wily (and tempting) while the men are... old professor types who know almost everything except the human heart.But Hawks makes twist on his own premise as he goes along, too. We see the natural progression of the plot, of Cooper quickly falling in love with Stanwyck's advances (all fake at first just so she can stay at the house), and then little by little she falls for him too, or at least feels so guilty about what she's doing to see the old geezers as real people instead of obstacles. There are a few key scenes that break the mold of the comedic antics (some of which, like Stanwyck showing the old men how to dance is hilarious and memorable): one is the bachelor dinner between the professors, when the one professor, played by Richard Haydn, talks about his marriage from many years before, and it becomes genuinely tender and sincere, not played for laughs, certainly not when they're all singing the song Gienevive. The other scene is when Cooper walks into the wrong room (thinking it's a professor and not his future wife) and asks for advice about what to do, as he loves her and isn't sure about himself. It's all shot in dark, with a few specific lighting touches, and it's about perfect.The ensemble is entertaining- from the old men with their various (sometimes interchangeable) personalities, to the film-noir knockoffs playing the henchmen of Joe Lilac- and there are many lines and moments that, upon a repeat viewing, should become even quotable. It could be said that it's slightly dated in some of its approach to tradition vs. the titillating, but it never loses its sense of humor, all the way up to the climax. Oh, and it also happens to feature one of the best nightclub music scenes in the movies, with Gene Krupa and his band doing ""Drum Boogie"", first in its usual form (a fantastic drum solo at the end), and then a variation on it with Krupa performing the song in a huddle of people with matchsticks on a matchbox.

His film performances that year are among his best, the Oscar winning Sergeant York, Frank Capra's classic Meet John Doe, and this sparking comedy Ball of Fire. However it was Barbara Stanwyck who snagged an Oscar nomination for this film with her portrayal of sassy nightclub singer Sugarpuss O'Shea. Stanwyck lost however to Joan Fontaine in Suspicion.A whole lot of talent went into the making of this film besides the two leads. Howard Hawks worked from a script by Billy Wilder and his writing partner, Charles Brackett. And Hawks put together a superb list of supporting players including seven of our finest character actors to be Cooper's professorial colleagues, Henry Travers, Leonid Kinskey, Aubrey Mather, Oscar Homolka, S.Z. Sakall, Tully Marshall and making his film debut, Richard Haydn.These eight cloistered academicians are working off a grant to create some kind of ultimate encyclopedia. Cooper's specialty is the English language. A garbageman played by Allen Jenkins awakens him to a whole generation of new slang terms he hasn't heard. Cooper ventures out into the world and meets a variety of people and hears a whole batch of new expressions. His wanderings take him to a nightclub where he hears Stanwyck singing with Gene Krupa's band.Stanwyck's just filled with all the new hep jive talk, but she's also ducking a grand jury subpoena to testify against her boy friend, gangster Dana Andrews. She decides a good place to hide might just be the house where all these professors are quartered.It's quite a mismatch, scholarly and shy Cooper and brazen Stanwyck, In fact Hawks modeled Cooper's Bertram Potts on the character Cary Grant played in Bringing Up Baby which Hawks also directed. Cooper was as successful as Grant in breaking his stereotype though he never quite got the physical comedy down the way Cary did.Still Ball of Fire is a great big ball of amusement. I'm surprised there hasn't been a remake of this recently. Danny Kaye did a remake called A Song Is Born later in the decade with Kaye being a music professor instead. But I can see the possibilities of a remake here with this group of academicians putting together a Wikipedia like encyclopedia or even an ultimate search engine for the internet like Google.",18,19,False

It has bucketloads of 1940s charm and a great creative team behind it, including acclaimed director Howard Hawks, Billy Wilder on writing duties and, of course, the ever-sultry Barbara Stanwyck as the femme fatale.And yet, it falls somewhat flat for me. It's too cutesy for my tastes. I know Wilder is a very respected film-maker, but I find all of his movies to be rather dated (with the possible exception of ""The Apartment"") and, at their worst, exceedingly twee. Everything about ""Ball of Fire"" is rather silly and precious, including its portrayal of absent-minded academics, comedy gangsters and a rather unbelievable romance between Stanwyck and Gary Cooper, who plays a total stiff.In my book, the film's saving grace is that Stanwyck generates a lot of heat (though not a lot of chemistry with Cooper). Some of her seductive dialog is so campy and dated that it's glorious. And the film as a whole has a pleasantly campy atmosphere. It's entirely silly and innocent, so in some ways it's preferable to the crass brand of movies that Hollywood churns out today.But, alas, ""Ball of Fire"" does not even approach classic status. Every time I caught sight of Henry Travers - who plays one of the goofy professors - I was reminded of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" an infinitely better movie.

The gangsters and the professors meet for a showdown and there can only be one winner....The film is a comedy that is drawn-out in several sequences and has a tedious sentimental segment at a dinner table that loses the audience's attention. The cast are mainly good - especially Stanwyck, Andrews and Duryea - and a mention must also go to the very likable Allen Jenkins who plays the garbage man. He's really ""Officer Dibble"" as always. Against these good performances are the numpty professors and the landlady Kathleen Howard, with an actually terrible performance from Richard Haydn as one of the professors. If you can't work out which professor he is then you have serious problems. He is DREADFUL with an atrocious comedy voice that fails to register a smile. A real weak link.Stanwyck provides sex appeal, comedy and strength as demonstrated in her scenes of seduction with Cooper, her teaching the professors to do the conga and her tough, no-nonsense character when confronted by Kathleen Howard. She smacks her one and it's great. There is also a fun segment showcasing Kid Krupa and his orchestra.Overall, the film is too long and so it cools off at various moments and Cooper plays another dumb-ass like he did in Sergeant York. However, it's a better film than the other Stanwyck film ""The Lady Eve"" released in the same year.",7,17,False
tt0033373,Energy Dissipates,4.0,"In this update of Snow White, 8 eunuchs are sequestered (for years) to produce an encyclopedia of all human knowledge. Along comes a fast-talking dame (Stanwyck) who instantly makes the Linguist's (Cooper) language section irrelevant. The movie really lives when Stanwyck is just allowed to do her thing (""...yunh, yunh, yunh!"" smirk) and when language is discussed. Early on, the movie delights in big-band era patois, half of it made up. Unfortunately, the promising scenario gets thrown overboard in favor of conventions (a ""lerve"" story, a paper-thin antagonist) and the quality of the movie disappears, the gags become overextended, and the conflict/resolution is, in the movies own parlance, ""total cornball, Daddy-O."" The more Gary Cooper is on screen, the more it dies. I barely made it through the second half involving some cardboard mobsters. And how many movies would have been superior if they'd been freed of the usual goal/machinations of gluing a couple together? Still I'd rather sit through this again than The Lady Eve. It's nice to see Stanwyck in a light-hearted comedy, instead of one more angst-filled melodrama. The double entrendres are little more shocking than the era permitted (""I'm a pushover for streptococcus""). Worth a few ounces of interest, the movie is teeming with character actors you've seen elsewhere: ...the chatty diner lady from Out of the Past, S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakal AND the bartender from Casablaca (Leonid Kinskey), Clarence the Angel AND the bank examiner from IAWL, the actor who was the voice of Popeye, and about ten others. Even poor old Dana Andrews is in it! It's like a nice, warm blanket if you're fond of old movies.Note: This is one of a handful of movies that Peter Bogdanovich borrowed from, to make What's up Doc?

tt0033373,Stanwyck and Cooper in a Serviceable 40s Comedy,6.0,"Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper give funny, sexy performances as a gangster moll and a nerdy professor, respectively, in this lightweight Howard Hawks offering from 1941.Stanwyck plays Sugarpuss O'Shea, girlfriend of a thug (Dana Andrews) who finds himself in hot water after a dead body turns up. She needs to hide herself away so that the police can't come after her for questioning, so through a twist of fate she ends up in a male boarding house where Cooper and his group of colleagues are hard at work developing an exhaustive encyclopedia. Libidos start to rumble, and the men delight in their new-found housemate, all but Cooper, who's determined to commit himself to his important work and not answer the call of the wild. Stanwyck proves too much for him, as of course she would for any red-blooded male, and the two fall for each other, which makes her situation much more complicated, as her gangster boyfriend has decided that the best way out of his mess is to marry her (wives can't testify against husbands according to the law).""Ball of Fire"" was not as zany or inspired as I was hoping it would be, or as it could have been given its premise. The likable group of actors who play Cooper's colleagues are responsible for much of the film's humour. They act like shy teenagers who have never seen a woman before, and fall all over each other to win Sugarpuss's favor, putting a flower on her breakfast tray or getting in arguments over who's best equipped to help her zip up her dress. Stanwyck and Cooper do generate some heat, and Stanwyck in particular has some wonderfully cute moments, like when she tries to kiss Cooper but has to erect a little footstool out of books because he's too tall for her to reach. But I wouldn't say that this movie is anything especially memorable. Rather, it's a completely serviceable comedy that doesn't really distinguish itself from any number of other serviceable comedies from the same time period.Grade: B+",6,15,False
tt0033373,"""The Theory and Practice of Being a Sucker.""",8.0,"Professor Bertram Potts (Gary Cooper) and his six assorted old oddballs who are trying to put together an encyclopedia are forced by hoodlums (Dana Andrews, Dan Duryea, et al) to take in Sugarpuss O'Shea (Barbara Stanwyck) and hide her from the police. Cooper and Stanwyck fall for each other and wind up getting married, while the hoodlums are swept up by the authorities.This is a very funny movie with romantic undertones. It's not outrageously funny. It's not the Marx Brothers. The high Amusement Quotient is due mostly to the characters and the relationships between them. The romance lies in the development of characters.It's unnecessary, and maybe self defeating, to spell out the funny parts and the gags. So let me mention in passing a scene that isn't funny at all but rather touching. The seven dwarfs are sitting around a table, drinking wine after dinner, anticipating Cooper's marriage to Stanwyck tomorrow. Cooper is bemused by his own emotions and by the prospect of physical contact with a woman. Only one of the professors, Robert Haydn, was ever married and is now twenty-four years a widower. He offers Cooper advice from his own marital experiences and, man, it harks back generations. ""We went to the Catskills where we did some very pretty watercolors."" And: ""A wife is like a flower. We must wait for the petals to open. A bee too anxious to pollinate might spoil the bloom."" Something like that, anyway. Havelock Ellis was more straightforward than that. So was Tiny Tim.But after giving Cooper his fatherly advice, Haydn takes out a locket and removes a lock of Genevieve's golden hair, and the others begin to sing ""Genevieve,"" and rather suddenly we realize the film has lost its comic tone and has turned rather effectively sentimenal, as Haydn dabs a handkerchief at his cheek, begs the others to sing it again, and delicately leaves the table. Oh, it's corny alright. (""Corny"", means old fashioned, countrified -- but it's not ""synonymous with 'baloney'"".) But Haydn's sentiment and the sympathy of the other tender-minded old clowns seems genuine enough. We know exactly what Haydn is feeling, although the scene isn't overextended or overwritten. Once Haydn is gone, the others shrug off the hopelessness of their ever having such a relationship, and they lapse into a resigned but robust version of ""Gaudeamus Igitur."" It may be Barbara Stanwyck's best role. She's unforgettable. In other films she often seems to be made of cast iron, sexless and driven. Here, she's light hearted and saucy. Best shot -- Sugarpuss knocks unexpectedly on Potts' door and when he opens it, she smiles like a T. rex, her head tilted, clicks her tongue and snaps her fingers, and says, ""Hi, Pottsy, old boy!"", and then tilts her head the other way and sweeps past him in this glittering gown, sparkling with Gustav Klimt designer speckles. (In a few moments she has him feeling her foot and looking down into her open mouth. Watch out, Pottsy, this babe has been known to bite.) She's pretty foxy too, sashaying around, fluffing her long curly locks, swinging her hips, fomenting rebellion among this flock of troglodytic dodos, teaching Cooper what yum-yum is.A number of Hawks' movies derive their humor, and sometimes their dramatic tension, from the conflict between the cerebral cortex and the reptilian brain. The eggheads versus the naturals. And that's the case here. An ordinary viewer is more likely to cheer Cooper when he throws away his boxing book and tackles Dana Andrews swinging as recklessly as a kid in a schoolyard fight. Well, we're all glad to see it finally happen. Yet I wonder if that's such a good lesson to learn. In addition to its other many functions, the cerebral cortex has a prominent role in damping down the impulses generated by more primitive structures. That's what keeps us from murdering each other. It' nice that Cooper manages to let himself go, but it's important to remember that the chief villain, Dana Andrews, a selfish murderer, has no problem whatever letting himself go. I've always suspected that Hawks spent most of his career getting even with the college professors who gave him poor grades at Cornell, though he spanks them only lightly here. Damned chrome domes. Come to think of it, Hawks may have been a dropout but Dan Duryea managed somehow to graduate from Cornell.It's a truly funny movie and ought to appeal to people of varying ages, genders, and social strata.",13,14,True
tt0033373,"Great balls of fire, what a great movie!",10.0,"I had heard so much about Ball of Fire, with people saying how wonderful it was. After finally seeing it, I really have nothing other than to echo these sentiments. The film looks wonderful, the costumes and settings look lovely and the cinematography doesn't look at all dated. The music is jaunty with an endearing touch of romanticism, the story is an updated version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and a scintillating one it is too, Wilder's direction is spot-on and the screenplay is witty and hysterically funny. I loved the performances too, Gary Cooper is gawky and very lovable and Barbara Stanwyk is alluring with a genuine sense of comic timing. Henry Travers, Richard Haydn and Dana Andrews are wonderful in support. Oh and fans of Stanwyk will get a treat from her performance of Drum Boogie with percussion king Gene Krupa.

tt0033373,The Egghead is Mightier Than the Hood,10.0,"What happens to an ivy tower atmosphere if it is invaded by a sexually alluring siren? Will it lead to events similar to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from their perfect cocoon of the Garden of Eden? But the sin of Adam and Eve was tasting of the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. The eight professors in the ivy tower already have all the known knowledge of the world - their only problem is trying to dispense that knowledge within a three year deadline. Will they now miss that deadline? That is the situation of Howard Hawk's comedy ""Ball Of Fire"", one of the two great comedies (with ""The Lady Eve"") that Barbara Stanwyck made at Paramount in 1941. People who think of Stanwyck as the dramatic equal of Davis and Hepburn only think of her in films like ""Stella Dallas"", ""Baby Face"", ""Double Indemnity"", or ""Sorry, Wrong Number"". Nobody denies Stanwyck's abilities as a fine dramatic actress, but she was terrific too in comedies (and it is interesting that her two finest comedies showcase her as a sexually alluring comedian). Katherine ""Sugarpuss"" O'Shea is a nightclub entertainer, who is also the girlfriend of mob boss Joe Lilac (Dana Andrews, in a rare villainous role). Joe is having trouble with the District Attorney of New York City (Addison Richards) who is trying to crack a murder that may be linked to the mobster. It turns out that Sugarpuss can cement the case, so Joe needs to hide his girlfriend...and maybe marry her (if they marry she can't testify against her husband). He sends his two henchmen, Duke Pastrami (Dan Duryea) and Asthma Anderson (Ralph Peters) to tell her to lay low...but where? Earlier that evening Sugarpuss got a visit from a Professor Bertram Potts (Gary Cooper) who needs her knowledge of street vernacular for an article he is writing in an encyclopedia on the subject of ""slang"". Although she initially rejected his request for help, she now finds it fits nicely into the needs of her boyfriend Joe. So she turns up at the building in Manhattan that Potts and seven colleagues (Richard Haydn, Aubrey Mather, Tully Marshall, Oscar Homolka, Leonid Kinski, Harry Travers, and S.Z. Sakall) have been living at for nearly a decade while working on this major encyclopedia for a foundation. That is the bare bones set-up for this film, one of Howard Hawks best comedies. Like ""His Gal Friday"" and ""I Was A Male War Bride"", Hawks makes his female lead fully capable at being a match or more than a match for the male characters. If Cary Grant's newspaper editor Walter Burns did connive and scheme against Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson, she gave him as good as he gave her until circumstances played into his hands. The situation is the same here, except that Sugarpuss is like a breath of youth and fresh air to Cooper and the seven older professors, so that for all their book learning they lack a certain amount of common sense in dealing with the charming singer. She manages to compromise them from the start, establishing a room for herself in their headquarters building that the foundation never made plans for.Not everyone is taken in: Kathleen Howard, the housekeeper Mrs. Bragg, finds out the truth from a newspaper and almost ruins Sugarpuss' schemes. But what is worse, perhaps, is the slow realization by Sugarpuss that the square, geeky Bertram is a decent guy - and a better boyfriend than Joe. Which sort of gums up the works for Joe and his schemes, and Joe is not the sort to like his schemes to be gummed up at all.Samuel Goldwyn produced ""Ball Of Fire"", and since he did he got a first rate director and cast together. Stanwyck appears to have been third choice for Sugarpuss (Lucille Ball was supposed to play the role, but was dropped when Stanwyck became available - she might have carried it off, for she played a similar role in ""The Big Street"" opposite Henry Fonda a few years later). One wonder is Hawks originally planned for Grant in the lead (one could see him as the expert on English, who is a naive professor - similar to his anthropologist in ""Bringing Up Baby""). But Goldwyn made several films with Cooper, and probably pushed for that leading man. Cooper shows enough naiveté in his performance to make his discovery of love all the sweeter. The real joy that he expresses when he realizes that Stanwyck favors him over Andrews is rather touching, even though it is presented at a moment of danger to Cooper and several others.As for the supporting cast, they are all good. Duryea is properly insolent and dumb as the hoodlum Pastrami. Allen Jenkins is a garbage man seeking knowledge for pecuniary gain (quiz show answers). The professors are individually cute, particularly Homolka, driving with an out-of-date driver's license (from 1906) but insisting Teddy Roosevelt thought his driving ""bully"", and Haydn, the only one of the professors to have ever married, who proves a sentimental type (he carries his dead wife's hair around in a locket). One also notes Mary Field as Miss Totten, the daughter of the wealthy inventor who created the foundation, who (despite the wise words of her lawyer Charles Lane) keeps giving the professors more time to finish their work because she is sweet on Cooper. We last see that young lady enjoying a chase sequence - it was more fun than she ever had experienced before. Finally there is a nice sequence where Stanwyck demonstrates her voice by singing ""Drum Boogie"" to the accompaniment of Gene Krupa and his band. She also (with the seven elderly professors) dances the conga. Stanwyck rarely appeared in musicals (I can only recall ""Lady Of Burlesque"" off hand), so it is nice to see her show her singing and her dancing here as well.",12,13,True
tt0033373,Barbara and the Seven Dwarfs...Wilder style...,7.0,"Billy Wilder seems to have written this vehicle especially tailored to the talents of BARBARA STANWYCK and GARY COOPER because they never had roles in romantic comedies that suited them as well.Babs is a sassy stripper on the lam from the law and sheltered by seven old men (and one young professor) assigned to work on a dictionary of slang. She teaches them a thing or two with her own street talk and soon insinuates herself into their affections, much the way Snow White did with the Seven Dwarfs.It's farce all the way, broadly played by the delightful cast of men, including S.Z. SAKALL, OSKAR HOMOLKA, RICHARD HAYDYN, HENRY TRAVERS, and DANA ANDREWS as her henchman lover.But it's her chemistry with Cooper that practically glows on screen, giving her character the softer touch and taking the brassiness out of her ""Sugarpuss"" characterization.Although the material is strictly ""cornball"" by today's standards, it's still a lot of fun to watch Cooper fall under her spell--and to watch Dana Andrews (in a good early role) getting his comeuppance.""Sugarpuss"" and ""Potsie"" are quite a pair!!

tt0033712,Most romantic moment in Hollywood history... unforgettable,10.0,"Even today, 70+ years after this film was made, with this reviewer (having seen it maybe a dozen time) now in his dotage, I will still occasionally bump into another cinephile, no matter male or female, who will recall this film for that one unforgettable scene where Montgomery's character, Joe Pendelton, finally gets a replacement body that suits him, and his angel (played by Claude Rains) gives him a merry sendoff by removing the memory of everything that happened in the film before that. To balance the cosmos, so to speak. Unfortunately, this also removed his memory of a girl he'd met in an earlier body (one that did not work out) so it seems that now, the course of true love is thwarted. But is it? In a long corridor inside the stadium where Montgomery's character, in his last (and final) body, has just finished a prize fight, as Montgomery passes by the girl he once was in love with (ie, in another body before his memory was diddled with); and the girl, convinced the man she'd loved (ie, Montgomery in an earlier body) was dead, passes him going the other way. Of course she does not recognize him (new body, new name); and he does not recognize her (aforesaid angelic diddling). But as they pass as strangers, the lights in the corridor momentarily go out. And when the lights come back on, each stops, aware that just for a moment, in the dark, they recognized something about the other that was not obvious to the eye. And then the girl suggests that maybe they should go have a coffee and talk about the experience. And I swear I get misty-eyed just writing about this scene, that's how powerful it is, and I promise you that none of the 700 remakes has captured it properly. In fact, the tears are welling up so fast I am going to have to go out and shoot a deer just to remind myself what a manly man I am.

Of course when you've got a new heavenly retriever on the job like Edward Everett Horton anything is possible.He snatches prize fighter Robert Montgomery from a private plane that's about to crash. Only problem is that Montgomery wasn't supposed to die in the crash. What to do, send for Claude Rains in the title role as the heavenly fixer, Mr. Jordan.Montgomery goes through two different bodies after that in an effort to give him the life span that the heavenly records are supposed to have for him. In one of those guises he meets Evelyn Keyes for whom he falls big time and she him. Of course there's a problem because Montgomery is a millionaire, married to Rita Johnson who with his private secretary, John Emery is trying to kill him.Through all of this lending his confused elfin charm is James Gleason as Montgomery's fight manager. Seems as though Gleason had a destiny also, to manage a heavyweight champion. Gleason got his career role in Here Comes Mr. Jordan as he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. The film itself was Columbia's entry in the Best Picture category, but also lost to How Green Was My Valley.This was Robert Montgomery's second Oscar nomination and the movie going public accepted him as good natured, saxophone playing pug Joe Pendleton a lot better than the homicidal maniac in Night Must Fall his first and other Oscar nomination. This time Montgomery lost to Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.My favorite in this film however is the wise and patient Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan.

tt0033712,Heaven Can't Wait,8.0,"During a flight in a personal airplane, a young boxer by the name of Joe Pendleton crashes into a wooded area - just within the first ten minutes of the beginning of Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Unfortunately, a heavenly escort prematurely plucks his body from the plane before the actual crash, thereby rendering Joe body-less, yet technically alive. Joe's body is promptly cremated, so his new friend, Mr. Jordan, promises Joe a new form and they begin a search for a replacement. The 1941 film centers around Joe Pendleton, an affable man and a capable boxer, who is on his way to a fight whenever he meets his untimely death. With the help of Mr. Jordan, Joe attempts to reverse his misfortune with a new body and a fresh opportunity to enter the title fight. Along the way, however, he meets the unexpected: a beautiful, independent, and charmingly belligerent woman that he falls hopelessly in love with. The film centers around Joe's struggle to realize his dream of winning a title fight, however, it is truly a romantic comedy with themes that tend to focus on love and the fulfillment of our dreams. The makers of the film use Joe's different forms to impart their view that love is a connection between two people, while the body is simply a shell and love is a faceless awareness that sees through physical realities. Don't be turned off by this seemingly heavy theme, because Joe's constant wisecracks and frequent squabbles with the man who took him from his body keep the film light and enjoyable. Despite the occasional sluggish scene, this timeless film offers enough clean-cut comedy and bearable romanticism to warrant a viewing. It deals with an important subject without taking any importance away from keeping the film light and fun to watch.",24,30,False
tt0033712,The soul lives on,8.0,"""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" stars Robert Montgomery as Joe Pendleton, a prize fighter who, hurtling toward earth in his damaged plane, is taken to heaven prematurely by a new heavenly worker (Edward Everett Horton). Upon reaching the gates, it appears that the book states that Joe isn't scheduled to head skyward until 1991. An attempt to return his spirit to his body fails since Joe was cremated; Joe ends up in the body of a business tycoon, Farnsworth, just drowned by his wife and male secretary, except Farnsworth is suddenly not dead. Joe as Farnsworth meets Bette (Evelyn Keyes) and falls in love with her while wreaking havoc with the man's money and business and continuing to aggravate his wife and secretary. Then Mr. Jordan comes to him with some really bad news.This is a delightful movie, and though ""Heaven Can Wait,"" its '70s remake, was very enjoyable, how could it be as good or better when Claude Rains and Robert Montgomery are in the original? Montgomery, who for years did light comedy as an elegant leading man, is wonderful as a streetwise prizefighter. James Gleason, as Joe's manager Corkle, has some great comic moments when he meets up with Farnsworth and Farnsworth claims to be the dead Joe. Evelyn Keyes is lovely in the ingénue role, and Rita Johnson makes an excellent murderous wife. Claude Rains played the devil in another film, and as Mr. Jordan apparently works with the Head Honcho on the other side. He exudes warmth and calmness and performs beautifully opposite the more volatile Montgomery characters.This film was released before Pearl Harbor, but everyone knew the U.S. would be entering the war. Thus began a spate of these films - ""A Guy Named Joe,"" ""Heaven Can Wait,"" ""The Bishop's Wife,"" ""Angel on my Shoulder,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Down to Earth,"" and others. The fascination with death, angels, destiny, and souls was understandably rampant as reflected by Hollywood from 1941-1948 as people sought to understand what happened to their loved ones.""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" is one of the really fine examples of this genre, with beautiful performances and story.

In fact, he is Murdoch, although he still looks like Robert Montgomery (no doubt ""Quantum Leap"" was inspired by this, four decades later).Sure, he has some faint residual feelings of Pendleton's that make him hire James Gleason to be his manager, and he and Evelyn Keyes will no doubt fall in love.

The body of financier Bruce Farnsworth is the selection after he is killed by his wife and secretary in order to continue their romance and get ahold of his finances. Betty Logan appears to get Farnsworth to settle the matter concerning her father, who was sent to prison in a deal swindled by Farnsworth, and Joe frees her father, but falls for her as well. In the meantime, Joe (as Farnsworth- everyone sees Joe as Farnsworth but Joe sees himself as his true being-) starts training for the championship fight (it was Joe's natural destiny to become champ), with the help of Joe's trainer, Max Corkle. This upsets Julia Farnsworth, who then decides to make certain that Joe/Farnsworth is killed. Joe and Mr. Jordan work to make sure Joe can find another body in order to become boxing champ, bring Julia and Abbott to justice, and keep the romance alive between Joe & Betty.

Rains plays the heavenly Mr. Jordan trying to fix Horton's heavenly blunder.  Rains is as always very good, and his scenes in particular bring a warm glow to the screen.  My favourite moments, however, are the scenes with rains and Horton talking ""shop"" and the ones with Horton and Montgomery bantering back and forth. Horton is a forgotten mine of comedic ability.

Problem is in the time taken to sort this out (which has involved top agent Mr Jordan), Joe's earthly remains have been cremated with no chance of him just being returned to his body. So begins a search for another body for Joe, a search that ultimately leads to millionaire Farnsworth  who has just been murdered by his wife and her lover.Looking at the basic plot (and even the detail of the ending) it does strike me as rather amazing that this did get made as a studio picture because it does have a dark streak to it that could easily have undercut any comedy, whimsy or romance and alienated the audience. Watching it again recently it does still surprise me that it pulls it off but somehow it is light, funny and with plenty of charm and somehow even the rather ambiguous ending comes off as lifting and happy. A big part of this for me is the cast because they get the delivery just right  in particular Robert Montgomery. Some have said that Rains dominates his scenes but I totally disagree, Montgomery owns the film because the tough but kind nature of his character is the engine that drives it to success. He is note perfect and his performance kept me with the tone of the film. Rains is nearly as good but is more of a cool presence in each scene.Hall's direction holds it together and makes the tone so that we never lose the slight hint of darkness but prevents it ever getting in the way of the comedy and fantasy of the piece.

tt0033712,Watch Out for Overzealous Angels,8.0,"Based on Harry Segall's play, ""Heaven Can Wait,"" Alexander Hall's 1941 original film adaptation boasts some fine performances, although the overall effort is pale in comparison to Warren Beatty's 1978 update. Boxer Joe Pendleton's soul is prematurely pulled from his body by an overeager angel, played by Edward Everett Horton, who wanted to save him from the pain of impending death in a plane crash. When Mr. Jordan, an angelic corporate manager, realizes the mistake, he tries to compensate with a comparable body to replace Pendleton's, which has been cremated.""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" falls in the supernatural genre that attempts to reassure viewers that the afterlife is comfortingly similar to the physical world. Robert Montgomery gives a fine performance as Pendleton, who is choosy about his replacement body, because he has aspirations to a boxing championship. When he tries out murdered millionaire Bruce Farnsworth's body, he becomes involved with a young woman in trouble, a scheming wife and secretary, and his incredulous boxing manager from the Pendleton days. Hall keeps the pacing brisk, and the film is a tight 94 minutes. Besides Montgomery, James Gleason is fine as the manager, and Horton plays the discretely coded gay character as well as ever. Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan is right for the role, although restrained. Unfortunately, for those familiar with ""Heaven Can Wait,"" the Beatty remake, the roles of the wife and secretary are lackluster in comparison to the inspired turns by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. Evelyn Keyes as Betty also suffers when compared to Julie Christie.The general tone of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" is more serious than that of its remake, and viewers may prefer the hilarity of Grodin and Cannon to the straight performances by Rita Johnson and John Emery in the original. However, the film's mood shift may owe to the differing historical periods. Perhaps a world on the verge of World War II was looking for reassurance that lost loved ones would live on, while viewers in the late 1970's approached the same subject matter as escapist romantic fancy.

tt0033804,Hell Hath No Fury As The Lady Scorned...,9.0,"On the surface of it, THE LADY EVE is a delightfully shallow evening's entertainment. It's a clever little film, filled with great dialogue (""Don't be vulgar, Jean. Let us be crooked, but never common."") and eccentric characters, from the leading lady Jean (a marvellous Barbara Stanwyck) and her much-beleaguered main man Charlie Pike (Henry Fonda) down to the other con artists that make up Jean's circle, including her dad Harry (Charles Coburn), sidekick Gerald (Melville Cooper) and Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith (Eric Blore)... or just Pearlie for short. Charlie is heir to the Pike Ale fortune, and while on a cruise home from South America, Harrington father and daughter decide to take the hapless lad to the metaphorical drycleaners. What neither of them gambles on is a romance that was always in the cards for Jean and Charlie. But just as Jean is about to go 'straight' for Charlie, he discovers that his girlfriend is part of a con racket, and unceremoniously dumps her. Hurt and determined to get revenge for his cruel parting words, Jean initiates a farce as the Lady Eve Sidwich of the film's title and infiltrates Charlie's home and heart again. She quickly teaches him a lesson he'll never forget, just as she realises how much she really still loves Charlie.Story-wise, then, it's no doubt that THE LADY EVE provides fine frothy entertainment. Pair that with the surreal touches added into the film by Preston Sturges (take for example the supposedly climactic scene in which Charlie repeats his words of love to Eve--Fonda never gets to play the scene straight, even though he has to maintain a stony face as his horse keeps butting into his speech... presumably to try to get him to stop talking!), and there's certainly plenty to keep one occupied as is. The film is, of course, a screwball comedy absolutely bent on throwing every possible obstacle it can into the path of its intended couple, coming up with more twists than you expect... However, thanks largely to the brilliant writing and direction provided by Sturges, it actually also plays very close and very insightfully to the theme of what Stanley Cavell calls 'remarriage comedy'. The idea behind this is that legal or religious marriages, the 'first' marriages of the couple concerned in such comedies, are actually sham marriages. It isn't saying 'I do' or signing a piece of paper that makes a marriage a marriage; it's the behaviour of the couple, their own endorsement, that makes it a true marriage. This theme is reflected in, for example, THE AWFUL TRUTH, which sees Lucy and Jerry Warriner divorcing (their first, sham marriage didn't work out) but getting back together again for a true, albeit not yet legalised, union. The same theme pervades THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Preston Sturges very skilfully and effectively--but subtly!--brings this theme to his film as well. Eve and Charlie are married, but it is only when Charlie asks Jean for forgiveness and vice versa is it possible for the fact that they are married (to each other, as poor Charlie does not know!) to become significant and actually positively affirmed.This isn't the only interesting point the film makes while appearing to be little more than a fluffy piece of entertainment--when Charlie breaks Jean's heart, she tells him, ""The best [girls] aren't as good as you think they are and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad."" She sets out to prove this, both in her fabricated 'good-girl' persona as Eve (later revealed to have had many MANY suitors) and her real 'bad-girl' con-artist self Jean (who has a soft heart and a love for Charlie that proves to be one of her virtues). Practically everyone in the film has (at least) two names by which they're known: Jean/Eve, Charlie/Hopsie, Muggsy/Murgatroyd/Ambrose, Harry/Colonel Harrington, Pearlie/Sir Alfred and so on. This suggests, quite rightly, that people are complicated complex beings, and that appearances often have nothing to do with reality. It also brings the film's story to a head--Jean and Charlie can never be happy together until Charlie can accept Jean as she is, and this he presumably will have learnt through his short, disastrous 'marriage' to Eve.Stanwyck and Fonda are really outstanding in this film. Stanwyck's job is to persuasively depict two characters, and then effect a blend of the two of them in the final minutes of the story, and she pulls off both the sassy, confident Jean and the elegant, British Eve perfectly. It's not hard to imagine Charlie falling hard for Jean, even with her hard-headed casing of the joint and her prospective competition (appropriately deemed second-rate) for his affections... a very memorable scene involving her make-up mirror and a narrative voice-over, the latter of which is used to great effect in the lead-up to the 'romantic scene and horse' bit which follows later in the film. Fonda has the apparently easier job of appearing mostly colourless and stodgy as he spends most of his screen time reacting to situations created by both Jean and Eve, but I contend that it must really take quite a lot of true acting ability to execute the pratfalls that he does without making Charlie such a wimp that you can't imagine Jean still wanting him at the very end. Though not quite as effective as Cary Grant, who has to do the same thing in the face of Katharine Hepburn's breathlessly effusive Susan Vance in BRINGING UP BABY, Fonda still brings a sweet charm to his role as the not-at-all-slick, often befuddled Charlie Pike. Add these two classy performances to that given by the able supporting cast, and THE LADY EVE is not just well-scripted and directed, but also very very well-acted indeed.;So, watch this film the first time just for fun--be charmed by the characters, by the dialogue, by the actors, by everything. Then watch it again to realise just how subtly and effectively THE LADY EVE actually makes several comments on marriage and on love. I highly recommend getting your hands on the Criterion Collection DVD, which has (aside from a tremendous photo gallery and interview with Peter Bogdanavich and other special features) a fantastic, thought-provoking commentary by film critic Marian Keane--it most certainly got *me* thinking!Great film, great entertainment, great message!",102,118,False
tt0033804,A Tonic For The Senses,,"As a lifelong Preston Sturges fan, I find the problem with submitting 'user comments' on his films to be twofold. The first is where to begin, the second how to stop. A third problem (growing out of the first two) manifests itself immediately upon watching a flawless jewel like THE LADY EVE: why even bother to praise it? No matter how accurate or elegant a rave you write, they'd still be merely words, and words can't do Sturges justice...not after hearing and seeing his own words spinning like a thousand plates over the 90-odd minutes it takes for this film to utterly captivate you. Unlike many black-and-white products of the studio era, which generate condescension or apathy among the Gen X'ers of today (when do we get to Gen Z - or are we there already?), the Sturges cult grows with every passing year, as younger fans fall under his spell, drawn initially to his work for the still-startling energy of the stream of raspberries he blew at the Production Code. (In this sense, EVE marks a high point; it's all about sexual gamesmanship, and its tone is both matter-of-fact and dizzyingly playful at the same time.) But hopefully, they're coming for the sizzle and staying for the steak. Like all Sturges' Paramount films, EVE is an embarrassment of riches - a boudoir farce, a slapstick clinic, a cynical dialogue comedy AND a love story of great, soulful heart. It's especially recommended to anyone beset by misery and tribulation as a guaranteed restorative and cure-all. When a movie from any era can so completely take you out of yourself and lift the blackest of clouds without resorting to any cheapjack plot-gimmicks or trite manipulation of an audience's emotions, all you can do is be grateful. Though the unfailingly superb Sturges Players are on hand, in fine form (including of course his human rabbit's foot, Wm Demarest) EVE features a number of actors making their first and only appearances in a Sturges-directed film: Stanwyck, Fonda, Eric Blore, Melville Cooper and perennial Fonda cohort Eugene Pallette. All of them take to the material like catnip, making one long for an alternate reality in which Preston Sturges could have remained unmolested at Paramount for 20 years and a dozen more films than he actually made, not only to see this cast reunited, but to see what might have resulted from any number of quality actors being exposed to the hothouse atmosphere of his screenplays.

Even the ""famous scene"" was just Fonda lying on the floor looking stupid while Stanwyck tricks him into loving her.  In fact I can barely remember the context of her speech let alone any funny/memorable lines from it (and i just watched the movie).  Now I realize that modern taste in comedy is a lot different from what was considered funny back then; but movies like ""Bringing up Baby"" most of the Marx Bros. films and Abbott and Costello are all funnier to me then this.  Fonda is especially bland and unfunny (oh wait, he's always bland and unfunny) in his role as the overly stupid wealthy bachelor.  He trips over stuff but has no funny lines and is vanilla as per usual.  Stanwyck is much better, and keeps things lively on her end.  Also to the films credit the pace is quick and things move along.  The movie wasn't horrible or anything like that, but I don't see why this particular movie became as famous as it did in front of any of the hundreds and hundreds of other studio releases from the same time period.  If your video store still caries old vhs tapes why don't you try out this experiment...Rent The Lady Eve, and then rent like 3 other old comedies from the late 30s and early 40s.

Stanwyck hadn't really cared about clothes before(see Mad Miss Manton) but this time Edith Head came up with some innovations that suddenly made her a fashion hit as well.  Her bolero jackets, evening dresses, wedding gown and cap hats were big fashion successes, tailored to Stanwyck's tiny form.

They single out wealthy Henry Fonda (Charles) as a target aboard a cruise ship but Stanwyck falls in love with Fonda and wants to back out of fleecing him of his money. Too late coz Fonda's bodyguard William Demarest (Muggsy) has found out how Stanwyck and Coburn make their living and tells Fonda about it, who subsequently ends his engagement plans with Stanwyck. Stanwyck plans revenge.....Stanwyck and Coburn are the standout characters in this film. Unfortunately, EVERYONE else is annoying - especially Fonda and Demarest - and when these 2 characters have so much screen time, this can't possibly make for a good film. So it's not. The film starts with some hope as Stanwyck dominates in some amusing scenes, eg, her running commentary as she watches the interaction of flirtatious women with Fonda through her face mirror before taking her own more direct way of effecting an introduction. The standout amusing scene for me is when Coburn is trying to fleece Fonda at cards and Stanwyck plays Coburn at his own game in order to protect Fonda from losing a fortune - clever Barbara.After this amusing beginning, the film just falls away, especially in the second half of the film where Stanwyck re-invents herself as part of the English aristocracy. She sounds exactly the same and looks exactly the same yet she fools Fonda completely into thinking that she is a different woman to the one that he had fallen in love with aboard the ship. How dumb is that? But it's one of Preston Sturges' trademarks - an unbelievable storyline. While the film is certainly better than his complete failure which is ""Sullivan's Travels"" which was released in the same year, it is still not entertaining enough and riddled with slapstick scenes like all his efforts which tediously drag on - ""Unfaithfully Yours"" and ""Miracle at Morgan's Creek"" are two good master-classes of his in how to bore an audience with slapstick and irritating actors.The film started with promise but Fonda is sooo irritatingly naive and given such crass dialogue, eg 'you sure are a strange woman for a man who's spent a year up the Amazon to be meeting' - what the hell kind of rubbish dialogue is that - that it's just impossible to relate to the guy. And if slapstick is your thing - routines that you can see coming from a mile off - then you need a brain transplant and you will enjoy this rather bland affair. And who on earth told William Demarest that he was funny......God help us!",22,44,False
tt0033804,"""Oh Hopsie""",9.0,"In this period of Henry Fonda's career, most of the good films was stuff he made away from his studio at 20th Century Fox. The Lady Eve is one of the best examples of that, With the success that Preston Sturges had with Christmas in July and The Great McGinty the year before, Paramount decided now they could trust Sturges with a big budget and an A list pair of leads. In fact they borrowed Henry Fonda from Darryl Zanuck and signed the then freelancing Barbara Stanwyck.This was a banner year in the career of Barbara Stanwyck. She did Meet John Doe, The Lady Eve and Ball of Fire in the same year, the last one she got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The Lady Eve came first and paved the way for a similar role in Ball of Fire.She's a street smart dame in both films, in the Lady Eve she's a shill for her conman father Charles Coburn and in Ball of Fire she's a nightclub singer and moll for gangster Dana Andrews. In both films she falls for rather withdrawn, naive, and bookish sort of men who bring out the mother instinct in her. In fact she has similar nicknames for them, Gary Cooper is called Pottsie and Henry Fonda is Hopsie.Stanwyck, Coburn, and Melville Cooper are a trio of con artists who are looking for a fresh pigeon and they find one in Henry Fonda who is a millionaire's kid. Fonda today would be called a trust fund baby, but he has an interest in science and he's coming back from the Amazon on a boat when meets up with the slick trio.Of course Stanwyck falls for the shy and bumbling Fonda, but there are many hurdles to overcome before these two find happiness.This may have been Henry Fonda's best comedy part. And like Joel McCrea in other Preston Sturges films, Fonda does so well in the part because he plays it absolutely straight. No tongue in cheek, no winks at the audience, Fonda plays it straight and sincere.The usual Preston Sturges stock company is here and prominent in the cast is always William Demarest as the mug that is a kind of bodyguard factotum for Fonda. Hired of course by Eugene Palette in another one of his crotchety millionaire father roles.Best scene in the film is right at the beginning as Stanwyck analyzes all the moves a lot of the other females on board are using to attract Fonda before she decides on a very direct approach.The Lady Eve holds up very well as do all of Preston Sturges's work after over 60 years. I do kind of wonder though if Stanwyck can control that streak of larceny in her even though she's marrying a millionaire who can give her anything.",34,43,False
tt0033804,Incredible cast & dialogue marred by poor direction,4.0,"""The Lady Eve"" suffers from the same problem all Sturges' films have: slow pacing that undercuts the energy of the scene.The cast in this film is outstanding, with the greatest ensemble of character actors I've seen. Barbara Stanwyck is unbelievably good, playing two characters that eventually blend into one. Her performance is on par with Katharine Hepburn's ""Philadelphia Story,"" but Hepburn had a lot more dialogue and a great deal more aspects to her character's persona to get across. While Stanwyck's attempt at an ""English"" accent is regrettable, her performance is otherwise flawless. Her conniving, seductive, confident, fun-loving, vulnerable, extroverted, and tender aspects are woven together so skillfully that you don't even question so many traits residing in one woman.Henry Fonda has been much-praised for his performance but I found it lacking. Part of that is due to poor writing -- his character is largely an easily duped buffoon who then bursts into soliloquies of such refined beauty that you wonder where his brain has been. Fonda doesn't pull it off; instead, he simply reacts to whatever is being done to him. The camera-work underscores this, focusing almost exclusively on the riveting Stanwyck. He's entirely unbelievable as an eminent scientist, since he exhibits very little rational thinking throughout the film. His expression barely alters throughout the entire film, going from befuddled to earnest and back to befuddled. Unlike Stanwyck, his face never actually *looks* highly intelligent. It's hard to understand what Stanwyck's character sees in him.This would have been a far more interesting film if almost one-third of it were cut. Sturges writes some brilliant dialogue which the actors deliver with flawless timing, but then he follows the character for what seems like endless seconds as they leave the room, enter the room, pace the room, or do whatever empty gesture soaks up some time. All the energy and sparkle created by the interchange during the scene bleeds slowly away.There is the usual Sturges montage, as boring as most. I found myself able to fast-forward through far too much of the film. (With ""The Philadelphia Story,"" for instance, you can't fast-forward without missing a critical bit of dialogue or character development.) The physical comedy would be far more interesting if he simply cut in, captured the action, and then cut out. His continually lingering camera-work mars the flow and pacing of the film.My wish is that the dead screen time could have been replaced with more sparkling dialogue. The film would be a much better picture that way. As for its being the ""greatest screwball comedy ever,"" it doesn't hold a candle to ""It Happened One Night"" and others of the Great Age of Hollywood. Perhaps Sturges should've just stuck to writing!",19,41,False
tt0033804,"Clever Sturges comedy and very, very funny...",,"I don't know how I missed seeing this until now, but tonight I watched THE LADY EVE unfurl on TCM and took notice of how great the chemistry was between BARBARA STANWYCK and HENRY FONDA. And even more so, how fantastic their ability with screwball comedy had to be in order to make their characters as believable as they are.Fonda, especially, impressed me with his honestly naive interpretation of a man without guile. He seemed totally hoodwinked by Stanwyck's con artist, even in those relentless close-ups that captured every expression on his Honest Abe face. Stanwyck, of course, had a role tailored to her abilities and was at the top of her form as an actress.I would have liked a better role for Melville Cooper who is somewhat wasted in his rather thankless supporting role but Charles Coburn, William Demarest and Eric Blore have no such trouble with full-bodied character parts.;Sturgess obviously is a master of long takes--and proves it again in his seduction scene where Stanwyck toys with Fonda's hair as she drapes herself across him, a spider spinning her web. Her best moment is the scene in the dining room where she uses her make-up mirror to make a running commentary on all the women who are ogling the rich catch (Fonda) while he becomes aware of the female attention. Although Fonda's pratfalls are painfully real, Sturges lets them occur a little too frequently. Demarest too has his share of falls--as he did in that other Sturges masterpiece, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK.Fonda's performance ranks with his mild professor in THE MALE ANIMAL. As for Stanwyck, her professionalism has never been more solid. She was nominated in 1941 for Best Actress in BALL OF FIRE but she is equally impressive in her dual role assignment here.",28,41,False

Some moments, like Fonda slouching on the floor and Stanwyck drooping onto him in a wry parody of Hollywood lovemaking, actually achieve the grace and beauty of the best silent films. The story takes some fairly predictable turns, and the script and direction by Sturges are first rate.  Fonda is very broad but miraculously pulls it off, and Stanwyck revels in the excellent role she plays (two roles in one, no less, an actor's dream!).  One of the best comedies of the ""classic"" Hollywood era.",28,41,False
tt0033804,The Tense of Pretense,,"Preston Sturgis made some of the best films in history, perhaps two. But he also made some real stinkers and this is one.His method was to divide the world of the film from reality in fresh ways. His talent was in the dividing, always the same distance. Sometimes the target was fresh, as in ""Sullivan's Travels"" sometimes not.The setup here is a story about a woman who tells a story about herself. She gets found out and her target tells his own (false) story. She gets back at him by weaving yet another performance within the performance. After wedding him, she spins yet another false tale on top.He balks. She regrets and arranges to set him back into the first story-within-the-story which he accepts as reality. And the picture ends happily ever after.It is a great setup. The problem is that the tone of the thing is all wrong. It breaks Ted's law where these levels need to be discriminated by equal changes in abstraction.Sturges understood the notion of levels and separation, but not the notion of abstraction which has become the standard for film perception.Oddly, he got it right the next film, and wrong again in the one that followed that.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",13,39,True
tt0033804,Outstanding classic comedy.,,"The Lady Eve is one of the most memorable comedies of the golden age, and today it stands as a highly entertaining movie that has a lot of enjoyably dated comedy. Particularly hilarious are the scenes in which Stanwyck spills her life story to Fonda as they swoosh under the train tunnel, and the scenes in which the food trays keep spilling on Fonda. The performances are great, and though it seems more like Stanwyck falls for Fonda out of pity more than love, the two work well together. And Barbara Stanwyck in that black, bare-midriff dress is one of the most breath-takingly beautiful images ever to appear on the screen.",24,36,False
tt0033804,Fun but nonsensical,5.0,"I realize that the screwball comedy genre has its own kind of logic, but ""The Lady Eve"" strikes me as having no logic at all. Though well written, which one expects from a Sturges film, I came away with the unsettling sense that the audience was being played for suckers. The turning point in the film appears to be the moment when Hopsie was presented with a photo of Jean and her father as evidence of their swindling career. This can come as no surprise to the audience, which has already seen how the Colonel can turn a five-card nothing into four kings, then four aces. But can a supposed scientist (I forget the proper name for ""snake hunter"") be so gullible as to fall for his blatant card-sharpery? And when he confronts Jean with the photo, can his sense of betrayal and humiliation really be so shocking to her? Yet this event sends Jean on a completely preposterous crusade of revenge. What exactly is her trick? To pose as an upper-class Brit who, by coincidence, looks exactly like Jean. And though Muggsy, Hopsie's dimwit ward, sees though the imposture immediately, our scientist falls for it, literally and figuratively, in no time.Jean/Eve finally delivers the coup de grace while on their honeymoon -- in a train, of course. As she divulges her numerous supposed dalliances, Sturges intercuts shots of train whistles, lightning and the obligatory tunnel. Maybe this Freudian stuff was novel back in 1941; today it verges on self- parody. Watching Hopsie detrain with a muddy pratfall (one of literally dozens in the film), Eve/Jean seems to have an attack of conscience, as though she's just now realizing he ""the only man I ever loved."" Stanwyck is sensational, even if her character(s) make no sense at all. William Demarest is very good, and occasionally hilarious, as Muggsy. The whole case, in fact, is first-rate. But Fonda's character is impossible to sympathize with, let alone root for, so improbably clueless and clumsy is Hopsie. Is he really surprised that an English aristocrat is not a virgin (the whole point of the setup)? Is he really so stupid as to fall for a grifter not once, but twice? Yes, evidently he is. It's clear to me that his real element is with the snakes of the Amazon, not those of Connecticut.",26,34,True
tt0033804,Didn't Do It for Me,6.0,"Maybe I wasn't in the right mood, but I just didn't think this film was that special. I can't say anything bad about it exactly, because there was nothing wrong with it. It just didn't have that spark that other movies of its type have.Maybe the problem lies with Henry Fonda, who I never thought had much chemistry as a romantic leading man. Barbara Stanwyck is great and sexy, so the fault doesn't lie with her.I almost feel bad about not liking this movie, because all of the elements for a good movie are there, and I can't give any rationale for my opinion. But for me it doesn't even come close to matching the allure of other screwball comedies from the 30s and 40s.Grade: B-",18,34,False
tt0033804,American comedy of fading interest,5.0,"Rich heir, Henry Fonda, and a beautiful, effervescent and effusive woman, Barbara Stanwyck, meet on luxury liner. Fonda, smoothly good-looking in white tuxedo, naive, uprighteous and ready for love, is obviously meant to fall in love with the scintillating woman. The love of the morally correct Fonda disintegrates when he learns that his shining goddess Stanwyck is the daughter of a shady father and he is reluctant to compromise his morality. The novelty for American society around 1940 is that Stanwyck later gives Fonda a healthy dose of ""what is good for the goose is good for the gander"" when she concocts a list of men she has been involved with in order to get her own back on being shunned by the uprighteous Fonda. However, the dialogue is generally dull and, with some exceptions, no longer witty in to- day's world of 2000: in fact in many cases the scenes are outright boring and too obviously clumsy to cause a chuckle or a laugh. The film's merit is Barbara Stanwyck's lively acting.",14,34,False
tt0033804,Overrated classic,5.0,"The Lady Eve has been hailed as a classic, given a digital release with great attention to it's restoration, and has garnered huge accolades. Which is a shame, given how many fantastic films are degrading virtually unnoticed and forgotten as we speak. Don't get me wrong, The Lady Eve is not a bad film, it's just not a particularly great film. Barbara Stanwyck turns in a great performance as the titular temptress, and Henry Fonda is fine as a wealthy herpetologist, but it's hard to believe that he (or anyone) could be naive enough to fall for all of Stanwyck's schemes. Ultimately it's a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy that isn't too romantic (due to an absence of chemistry between the leads) and not very funny either (the comedy consisting mainly of continuous pratfalls by Fonda). If you are a fan of Stanwyck or Fonda, you'll probably want to see it anyway, but if you are looking for a good classic romantic comedy, I'd recommend watching Sabrina instead.",18,33,False
tt0033804,Great 1940s Comedy with Fonda and Stanwyck,,"OK so the plot of The Lady Eve doesn't make a lot of sense, but why should it? It's fast, funny, and offers two great stars--Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda--great roles. Although both stars were better known for their dramatic roles, Fonda and Stanwyck breeze thru this romp in classic style.Fonda plays a rich goofus who falls for Jean (Stanwyck) onboard an ocean liner but she turns out to be a crook so he dumps her. To get even, she pretends to be the British Lady Eve and crashes his Connecticut manor. He falls for her again.Surprisingly racy lines for a 1941 comedy and a totally wonderful supporting cast make this a must see. Charles Coburn plays Stanwyck's father. Eugene Palette and Janet Beecher are Fonda's parents. William Demarest is the valet. Eric Blore is the faux earl. Melville Cooper is Coburn's valet. Robert Greig is the butler. Torben Meyer is the purser, and Martha O'Driscoll is a maid. The film is full of other faces familiar from Preston Sturges comedies: Jimmy Conlin, Al Bridge, Julius Tannen, Robert Warwick, and Robert Dudley. Also look for Bess Flowers, Barbara Pepper, and Luis Alberni.First and foremost, however, are Stanwyck and Fonda. They made 3 films together and they are perfect Sturges types. He is still and gawky but basically good. She is slightly bad and sexy but basically good. It would be easy to replace Fonda in this film with another Sturges favorite, Joel McCrea, or replace Stanwyck with Veronica Lake (the star's of his Sullivan's Travels) and this would have been a good film. But Fonda and Stanwyck make this edgier than Lake and McCrea could have made it. Indeed if Fonda had been the star of Sullivan's Travels, that film would be in the top ten on all film fans' lists.But The Lady Eve is just terrific. It's a comedy that runs hot on pacing, great lines, and the charisma and chemistry of two major stars. How odd that this classic comedy received only one Oscar nomination--for writing. Preston Sturges would be nominated for writing 3 times and win for The Great McGinty. He was never nominated as a director. The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, Miracle of Morgan's Creek, and Hail the Conquering Hero remain cornerstones of 40s comedy.The Lady Eve is a must see for fans of great comedy and the likes of Sturges, Stanwyck, and Fonda!",23,32,False
tt0033804,An Interesting Combination That Works Very Well,,"This is an interesting combination of talents and material that works very well, thanks most of all to Preston Sturges's ability to create a distinctive feel to his pictures. ""The Lady Eve"" has many of the elements familiar to screwball comedy, and yet it is something a little different, a little more than the oddball characters and comical plot developments.Barbara Stanwyck has quite an interesting role that allows her at times to assume several different personas. She shows good versatility, and effectively brings out the different sides of her character's nature. Henry Fonda works better than you would expect in such a comic picture. He is wisely used as a straight man most of the time, and even his occasional stiffness actually fits the role.Much of the supporting cast gets only limited opportunities, but they are generally good also, especially Charles Coburn, who is perfectly cast as Stanwyck's shifty father.There are many amusing moments, yet often with a current of humanity underneath.

Always the most subtle, internalized of actors, his facial expressions are priceless, as is his slapstick. The funniest scene takes place on a train when, as the train races along the tracks, Eve recounts her various love affairs while Fonda becomes more and more flummoxed.Betty Grable got a lot of publicity for her legs, but Stanwyck's were the best, shown to great advantage here, as is the rest of her gorgeous figure. She's fantastic in this and has great chemistry with Fonda.

tt0033804,The Suckersapiens and the Grifters,10.0,"""The Lady Eve"" marked an important milestone in the career of Preston Sturgis. Unlike his first two directed films (""Christmas In July"" and ""The Great McGinty""), Sturgis got a bigger film budget from Paramount and had two leading stars in his lead parts. ""Christmas In July"" had Dick Powell and Ella Raines in the lead roles. ""The Great McGinty"" starred Brian Donleavy and Akim Tamiroff. Now he had Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwick. The success of the first two films convinced the studio to trust him.Are snakes necessary? That question is one of the double entendres that bedeck this story of a young innocent millionaire who finds love the hard way. Charles Pike (Fonda) is a ""Candide"" type, coming out of the Amazon Jungle with his factotum aide Muggsy (William Demerest) where he has been studying his passion - snakes. He is an available bachelor, and all the woman on the ocean liner that picks him up aim for him. The one who makes the least effort is Jean Harrington (the daughter of one ""Colonel"" Harrington - Charles Coburn). Jean does not smile or order Pike's Ale (""The Ale that won for Yale""), which Charles father (Eugene Palette) brews. She gets straight to the point - she trips him. His accidental falling over Jean's foot is symbolic of his eventually falling for Jean.Jean's motive is not love - she and her father and their ""valet"" Gerald (Melvin Cooper) are professional card sharks, and they plan to pluck Charles. But Charles and Jean fall in love, and she starts revolting against her father's view of the saps he cons whom he refers to as ""suckersapiens"". The scene where she uses her wiles to thwart her father's attempts to make a killing at poker is quite funny, especially with Coburn's sudden reactions (""What wonderful cards you've given to me."", he mutters when she gives him an impossibly bad hand). The romance falls apart when Charles learns of Jean's card-sharping career. Later she meets an old con-artist friend, Sir Alfred MacGlennon Keith (Eric Blore) who knows the Pikes. Introducing Jean as his niece, ""Lady Eve Sidgewick"" , she enchants the society of the Pike family's town, and only gains the suspicions of two people: Charles who does not know what to make at ""Lady Eve""'s great resemblance to Jean, and Muggsy, who is sure they are the same woman.You will enjoy the disastrous dinner party for Eve, where Charles changes clothes more frequently than a female model at a fashion show. You will enjoy Charles' attempt to propose to Eve, and the silent commentary of a horse who butt's in. You will also find out how Charles and Eve spent the most memorable railroad honeymoon in film comedy.Are snakes necessary? Yes, but so are card sharks and suckersapiens too.",14,23,False
tt0033804,A Pleasant Romantic Comedy That Gets Better As It Goes Along,5.0,"This is a very pleasant romantic comedy, more mildly amusing than outrageously funny in my opinion, that gets better as the story progresses. One has to like the chemistry between a very dapper and young Henry Fonda (Charles Pike) and a very beautiful and young Barbara Stanwyck (Jean Harrington/Lady Eve). The two worked perfectly together and made a believable couple.For all the chemistry, I must confess that the first half of the movie did little for me. Charles and Jean meet on a cruise from South America to the United States. Unknown to Charles, Jean and her father (Charles Coburn) are con artists who seek to bilk people out of their money in card games. Love, however, intervenes. Jean and Charles fall head over heels, and Jean doesn't want Charles to be cheated. Charles, however, discovers her identity and ends the relationship. I didn't find much funny in this part of the movie. It picks up, however, in the second half. Jean decides to get her revenge by masquerading as an English heiress of some sort; hoping to get Charles to fall for her again and then take his money. The humour picks up here. First, it's hard to tell from scene to scene whether ""Eve"" loves Charles or not. Henry Fonda's physical comedy at the dinner (tripping over couches a la Dick Van Dyke) and constantly having food and assorted other things spilled all over him is truly funny, and the scene on the train after they marry, as ""Eve"" takes her revenge by telling her new husband about all the men in her life, whom he knew nothing about, got me laughing.I was never clear about the importance of the snake, except to draw some sort of connection between this Eve and the Eve of the biblical creation narrative, although I'm not sure why that connection was necessary to the story.As I said at the outset, this is a pleasant movie, but in my view nothing more than that.

Very versatile however, she had only 3 years to go to starring as the best femme fatale ever, as Phyllis in Double Indemnity. The satirical scenes with Eve's reception into American Society can be very funny but you can't help shaking your head at old Hollywood's pre-occupation with nobility or good breeding. Of course nowadays we've gone to the other extreme: born and live your life a drunk and violent junkie pimp in a dark sewer makes you a hero!Back to soft fantasy: imho an almost brilliant romantic comedy black and white 1940's film overall with a few faults mainly centred on implausibility, but a catchy insistent theme tune I have a job shifting afterwards: Recommended.",8,18,False

He is supported by a peerless cast which includes Barbara Stanwyck and Walter Brennan, both on top form.Perhaps most impressive is the illustration of Capra's democratic ideal by including the views of the audience throughout the story. You can find all your views being voiced by different characters at various points in the tale, opening the question of just who is the average everyman that Capra is seeking to show? - and how do they relate to you?This movie is ten stars all over. Even for keen Capra fans, the expectation is surpassed by the final delivery. Thoroughly recommended.",59,65,False
tt0033891,"Dark yet optimistic, beautifully realized piece of Americana as only Capra can dream up.",8.0,"Frank Capra's unabashed patriotism wins another pennant for Team U.S.A. with `Meet John Doe,' an Oscar-nominated feature (for original screenplay) that roots for the underdog while demonstrating the power of the people en masse. He backs up his strong, daunting ideology with sharp, crisp writing and even sharper character delineation.  Capra's social piece was timely released in 1940, when Nazi sympathizers were gaining a potent voice in America, just prior to our involvement in WWII.Struggling columnist Ann Mitchell (the incomparable Barbara Stanwyck)  is one of many about to receive their walking papers as the latest casualties of a newspaper takeover.  Learning that her dismissal is in part due to a writing style that lacks bite, she vents her anger on her last assignment, fabricating and printing a somber, biting `John Doe' letter.  `Written' by a despairing, unemployed man, who, tired of life's indignities, has given up on an indifferent, capitalistic society, the writer vows to throw himself off the top of City Hall on Christmas Eve.Ann's last column sparks a major outpouring of varying concern, not only from top government officials, but from newspaper competitors who claims the piece is a work of fiction designed to promote sales subscriptions, and from the public who are genuinely moved by this man's plight.  Caught between a rock and a hard place, the new editor-in-chief (James Gleason, in a marvelous turn) reluctantly keeps Ann on the payroll (with a bonus) while deciding to run with the story.  Auditioning indigent men to lend a face to their `John Doe,' they find their man in 'Long John' Willoughby (played to perfection by Gary Cooper), an ex-baseball player who has fallen on hard times.  Willoughby becomes an instant celebrity and an identifiable symbol of integrity and humanity.  `John Doe' clubs soon start sprouting up all over the place promoting `good neighbor' policies.  Trouble brews, however, when a ruthless financier (played with typical malice by Edward Arnold) agrees to sponsor `John Doe' appearances for radio and the lecture circuit, then threatens the movement by using it for his own political aspirations.Cooper and Stanwyck are ideal in their top roles.  Stanwyck is peerless when it comes to playing smart, gutsy gals.  Here, she shows all sorts of vibrant colors as an assertive reporter trying desperately to climb up the newspaper ladder without getting her hands too dirty, trapped on both sides of the fence and playing both sides superbly.  Coop too is deeply affecting, the epitome of the `aw shucks' kind of 'everyman' who manages to find a stirring, articulate voice underneath all that awkwardness and reticence. Nobody plays this kind of role better.It helps too that the leads are surrounded by all-star character pros. James Gleason is marvelous as the frustrated editor who must wrestle with his conscience as the hoax he orchestrated gets seriously out of hand.  He has one exquisitely tipsy scene in a bar with Coop where he lays all the cards out on the table.  Regis Toomey, as a prime spokesperson for the ""John Doe"" movement, has a touching moment as he expresses the impact the club has made on his community.  Edward Arnold is exemplary as the manipulating moneybags, and Walter Brennan's straightforward Colonel is insightful as Coop's obstinate buddy who sees his friend falling into the same opportunistic trappings he is supposedly rebelling against.  The one veteran, scene-stealing player not up to snuff is Spring Byington, who is stuck on the bench in a rather benign, devoted mom role.The only foul ball I found in this fast-paced, smooth-running story takes place atop the City Hall with an overly hysterical Stanwyck punching home Capra's idealism ad nauseum.  It could have been more effective with a still strong but subtler set-up and approach.  So, hey, it's not quite a shutout, but why quibble when the rest of the film is way ahead of the game.Like the equally dark `It's a Wonderful Life,' Capra's genius is that he knows how to pitch and score the important points when necessary, not only with laughter and tears, but with unyielding hope and, most significantly, with words.  It's more than any home crowd can ask for.",57,65,False
tt0033891,Capra and Riskin at their best,,"There is so much to recommend this film, especially in repeat viewings. I'll try to touch on things rarely mentioned. The opening credit montage that ends with a solitary newborn in a hospital ward speaks volumes, as does the opening scene: the jackhammering of the old Bulletin cornerstone. The dream that Long John tells Ann about, in which he plays a dual role, is a warm and economic device for letting us know about what he feels for her and why she could go for her. The near-monologue of Bert, the ""soda jerker,"" is as masterful in its sustained understatement as the small-town mayor's bumbling is hilarious. All of Capra's sound films starting with ""American Madness"" employ an effective, trademark montage, but ""Meet John Doe"" overflows with three. The Colonel's joyous Three Little Pigs dance inside the freight car to the rhythm of the rails is joyous. The Jesus metaphor throughout becomes heavyhanded at the very end but is saved by the dead-on final line about ""the people."" Finally, the movie succeeds not just because of its attributes that can carry over to other forms of art such as books or plays, but also because it is a uniquely cinematic experience.",38,41,False
tt0033891,Big problems,4.0,"Meet John Doe is a problematic film. It is best watched at superficial level, not asking any of the deeper questions it keeps glossing over. It's easy to get sidetracked wondering what Capra is saying about a dozen implied topics; socialism, communism, the American work ethic, human nature. This may be due to Capra being naïve and not even knowing he has invoked them, or it may be that he underestimated viewer intelligence. Ultimately Capra probably isn't saying a damned thing about most of the ideas he leaves in his wake.That these protagonists, cynical, smart, knowing, are oblivious to the scale of the powers they've involved... That the entire middle scale of the John Doe movement is absent... That the first time the movement encounters a major philosophical hurdle is as late and as singular as shown here... That a boob as inarticulate as Gary Cooper could persuade people he has a single idea in his head (let alone a coherent platform); all of these problems occur not with any real intent, but because it's inconvenient to answer them. which undermines any effort to construct a persuasive philosophy/movement.The films excesses come in the form of sequences that go on and on and on, long after they've made their point, or which fail to make a point after just as long. i.e. John mimes a baseball game in his hotel room (ugh.), John recounts a pointless dream ad nauseum, a soda jerk gives a gee whiz speech whose entire point is to show you how wholesome and earnest people are. But the Soda Jerk is gratingly unaware of the concept of 'summarizing,' that instead of liking him, I just want him to shut up.The biggest problem of all is the terrible, central performance of Gary Cooper, whose every scene is more insipid, irritating and objectionable than the previous one. How does the public imagine someone who can't get a single damned sentence out, is effusive enough to compose any of the films long ideological arguments? His cutesy mannerisms are way too much. I wanted to strangle him. Any time would have been a good time to stop the hard sell of John's irrelevant wholesomeness. The personal is hardly important in the face of major unanswered questions.Lastly, the thing that has always annoyed me about this movie is that they just don't have an ending. The last moments are the wrong time to finally acknowledge the dramatic & ethical dilemma apparent to a viewer six minutes into the movie. People come to movies not just to see dilemmas portrayed, but resolved. The film fails to work itself out of any of the traps it brings into existence. By the end of the movie Capra has lost control of everything; the dramatic arc, the ideological aspects and the entire scale of the endeavor. As long as it is, it feels imcomplete, like The Magnificent Ambersons, a bastardized remnant that was wrestled out of its creators hands, chopped up and defaced with an 'improved' ending.When I first saw this movie twenty years ago I absolutely detested it. This review actually represents fewer problems with it than I used to have. One can imagine any number of movies with which it would make an interesting double-bill; Citizen Kane, Nothing Sacred, All the Kings Men, Network, or the Fountainhead (It seems to borrow all the structuralist 'types' of Ayn Rand). The movie just ends up a bland call to activist citizenry, which is a small potatoes for all the ideas it puts in play. It persuades me that Americans aren't innocent in some general way, over time, but that they're newly ignorant constantly. I welcome that it asks more of viewers than most films, but it's a mess.",21,39,True
tt0033891,The Forgotten And Anonymous Get A Voice,10.0,"Meet John Doe was rudely jerked back into relevance in the Nineties by the emergence of a third party presidential candidate, wealthy enough to finance his own campaign, who ran in two presidential elections.H.Ross Perot and Edward Arnold's D.B. Norton have some definite similarities. Both men of wealth, both ego maniacal enough to try and eschew the normal political route to the White House. Both firmly convinced they are what the USA needs.Perot for all those graphs and charts didn't have much going for him in his candidacy other than a grudge against the Bush family. Although his platform isn't spelled out in Meet John Doe, Arnold says quite bluntly there's a new order of things coming and America needs a firm hand in the leadership. 'New Order' in 1941 meant fascism.There's a marvelous bit of imagery that Frank Capra give us right at the beginning, it's one of my favorite moments in his films. The image of the old Daily Bulletin sign being sandblasted away about a free press guaranteeing a free people and vice versa. Replacing it is something about the new Daily Bulletin being a streamlined paper for the modern era.Streamlining involves layoffs and the new editor James Gleason is giving out pink slips a plenty. One goes to Barbara Stanwyck who writes an innocuous chatty column. Gleason won't listen to her pleas so she fakes an anonymous letter from a man who signs it John Doe who threatens to jump off the City Hall Tower on Christmas Eve.Stanwyck gets more than she bargained for and she and Gleason have to come up with a real John Doe. A sore armed former baseball pitcher, Gary Cooper, fills the bill.This gets bigger and bigger and soon Arnold sees possibilities in it. Cooper goes on radio and delivers some homilies about love thy neighbor and being kind to others. He puts it over and a John Doe movement on these principles commences.Homilies and bromides they may be. But love thy neighbor is a concept that should never go out of style. As is proved it's quite a bit bigger than the political aspirations of a snake.This was the first teaming of Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. They followed it up with Ball of Fire another classic. Said to say that their third film, Blowing Wild, from the fifties hardly lived up to the first two. Capra used a whole lot of familiar faces from his previous films in Meet John Doe. Also one new face who made his one and only Capra film, Cooper's good friend on screen and in life, Walter Brennan. He's Coop's cynical traveling companion on the open road, the Colonel. Edward Arnold is one cold and sinister force in this film. I'm not sure but that this may be his penultimate role as a screen villain. His ambitions here would warrant that appraisal.One performance I like is that of Regis Toomey. He plays a soda jerk who starts a John Doe Club in his small town. He has some great lines that he delivers simply and eloquently about how Cooper's first radio speech inspired him to really get to know some of the neighbors he had not bothered with before.The lessons of Meet John Doe are simple and profound. Love Thy Neighbor and be kind to others are taught in all major religions and philosophies and the power is there when its focused. The other lesson I like is that the ordinary common people have a lot more in common than the things that divide them, be it race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, you name it.Meet John Doe is a profound and moving film, but I be it's not one of H. Ross Perot's favorites.",27,38,False
tt0033891,The third film in Capra's unofficial trilogy is darkly wonderful.,9.0,"After doing Mr Deeds Goes To Town and Mr Smith Goes To Washington for Columbia, Capra quit and made this third film about an average Joe thrust into a powerful world where exploitation is high on the agenda, but in true Capra style the story unfolds to a customary flip flop triumph.Ann Mitchell is a struggling journalist who gets fired from her newspaper job by new editor Henry Connell, by way of venting her frustrations she writes in her stinging last article about a man called John Doe who is tired of being pushed around and held back by the big bosses, she finishes the piece by claiming that Doe will commit suicide on Christmas Eve by leaping off the roof of city hall, the public react to the letter with tremendous heart and Doe becomes a champion of the people.After Connell gets interested in the letter Ann has to confess that she made it up, they hatch a plan to turn a real unemployed drop out into John Doe so as to continue the story and sell more papers, and of course Ann gets to keep her job. This brings in ex minor league pitcher Long John Willoughby, who is down on his luck and very short of cash, and this is when the story shifts from amiable comedy on to a much darker path, the result making for a riveting watch.Whilst not being up with the best Capra films in his armoury, it is, however, one of his smartest. The portrayal of the human spirit in many guises is stark and poignant, whilst thematically Capra got his point over about the unsavoury elements blossoming in America. The cast are nailed on watchable, Gary Cooper is John Doe, the right amount of sympathy and guts is garnered from his performance, and in one rousing speech he has the viewers in the palm of his hand. Barbara Stanwyck is Ann Mitchell and she delivers a great turn that calls for a number of emotions to be performed convincingly, while the support cast are all solid with the stand out a bizarrely unnerving Edward Arnold as D B.

tt0033891,Capra must be the epitome of bathos,1.0,"Capra's movies are so either 1) poor; or 2) dumbed down to an 8th-grade level. I can't know which.In John Doe especially it was bad direction. Cooper was one of the good actors. Hanging Tree and High Noon alone show that. Pride of the Yankees was OK. Stanwyck could be OK. And even Walter Brennan could be decent in small doses. But Capra can't even make Cooper shine - he just lathers it on until you want to hurl.And his technique is silent-movie era: In A-list movies Hollywood had moved away synecdoche 20 years earlier but there it is with Capra, not once but many times. And the double takes, slapstick falls, contrived scenes, long moralizing speeches - Wha? It's embarrassing.Even if you take our the sugar & sentiment, you've got a bad script and horrible acting. When I see a movie like this I just can't even guess why Capra was so popular. The entire movie was a shuffle of 3-4 stock scenes: some slapstick; one character makes a long speech to one/ more others; more slapstick; another long speech; someone bursts in through a door; another long speech; repeat again and again and again.You have Stanwyck jumping around and saying things like ""golly, gee, well wait a minute mr conning just hold your horses right there"". Walter Brennan playing Walter Brennan for the 100th time. And a huge cache of stock characters: the young reporter who trips over things; the helpful girl Friday; the assistant who walks in, does a double take, goes to the door, walks back, 2nd double take, says ""now wait a daggone minute"". A makes a comment; B says ""OK yeah great"", then a trumpet plays and B looks back again with ""hey now, uh"" and looks around.I came away from John Doe feeling as if I was trapped in some 1930s farmer's living room ""Golly gee Mabel it sure is hot out there."" ""Well Elmer, you just set and have a nice glass of sweet tea and then we'll sit in the shade and pet the dog."" A living Normal Rockwell print.Oh, and then there's the plot: Stanwyck's character writes a fake letter. The newspaper editor jumps on it with glee. All the talk is about how they might get caught. Where's the holier-than-thou attitude about how newspapers are special in the 4th estate? (Kirk Douglas did a nice job of disabusing that in Ace in the Hole.

At first, he does it for the money, but then, he feels bad because some people really have faith in him, and trust him.  He feels guilty about being a fake.

Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it.  Well you go ahead and try, you couldn't do it in a million years with all your radio stations and all your power.

There is some great acting in here, almost mesmerizing at times. The story is a typical Capra-esquire populist one in which the average man is elevated to high status, his worth and valued boosted in a cynical world. Yes, it's a far-fetched story but it's fun to watch and has some powerful messages, leading with ""Love thy neighbor."" I was very impressed with Barbara Stanwyck's speech near the end, noting Jesus' words to that effect while pleading to Gary Cooper. By the way, having Cooper and Stanwyck as the leads isn't all bad, either! Adding actors like Walter Brennan, James Gleason and Spring Byington make it all the better.Photography-wise, the film has an almost-eerie look to it in parts and is very interesting to view. I have yet to see this on DVD, but I plan to soon, I hope. Script- wise, it has a very good mixture of drama, comedy and romance.

The baseball scene in the hotel is a waste of time. Barbara Stanwyck's attempts to create a news story from a fake letter is eerily reminiscent of today's headlines, but any good editor would have fired her.

It might be easier for me to take the film's purpose seriously if America had not gone to war against the European fascists barely seven months after the film's release, with the lusty support of virtually the entire American people. Makes you think we weren't so close to a fascist takeover after all, doesn't it?Capra previewed five different endings for this film to find the one the audience liked best (and ended up with sentimental bilge, because that's what John Doe wanted).

tt0033891,uplifting and moving and a message for all,,"Spoiler Director Frank Capra gives us yet another moralistic gem in the form of Meet John Doe. With a stella cast which include Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, Edward Arnold and James Gleason. Capra delivers a movie with a message of human kindness and compassion released exactly the same time as man was killing fellow men all over the world.In order to keep her job at a failing newspaper Ann Mitchell (Stanwyck) concocts a phoney letter from a man who is determined to end his life in protest at the state of humanity and civilization, by jumping from the tower of city hall on Christmas eve. The plight of the non existent man known only as John Doe touches the hearts of the papers readers. The Newspapers hard edged editor Connell, (Gleason), is now in a spot as Mitchell has declared that the letter was fake. With everyone trying to save John Doe and the Newspapers circulation improving, Connell and Mitchell decide to flesh out their creation by hiring someone to be John Doe. Enter Long John Whiloughby (Gary Cooper) a failed Baseball player who's homeless and looking for a job. In return for money for an operation to enable John to continue his baseball career, he agrees to appear on radio as John Doe, explaining his reasons for his intended suicide and explaining that mans cruelness to others should cease and loving thy neighbour is the way forward for the world. Connell and Mitchell must first explain their actions to corrupt oil magnate and paper owner D B Norton (Edward Arnold). After the Radio broadcast, John decides that he's being made out a stooge and goes back to his nomadic lifestyle. When recognised in a small hick town, He is soon aware of how much his radio broadcast has united the towns community. The community elect a spokesman in the form of Bert Hanson (Regis Toomey) who explains that they have formed their own 'John Doe Club'. John is visibly moved by what he has caused, and agrees to do a lecture tour of all the states in the hopes of uniting others. D B Norton however, has other plans for the John Doe clubs and that is to unite the people through the John Doe cause and then exploit them by cornering their votes for his new 'third' political party and then rule with an 'Iron Hand' (sound familiar) Whether this party is Communist or Fascist is not explained but Norton does have his own Uniformed army at the ready not to mention many crooked politicians and Labour leaders in his slimy pockets. During the Lecture tour, John and Ann develop their romance. On the Eve of a mass John Doe Convention, Connell becomes aware of Norton's scheme and tells John that he and the whole John Doe Movement is about to be exploited, to which John confronts Norton and is determined not to let his evil new order come to fruit. Wrongly thinking that Stanwyck is in cahoots with the would be dictator, tears up the intended speech and says he's gonna tell the people the truth. Norton's henchman are prepared for this eventuality and expose John as a phoney in front of thousands of John Doe members. Doe barely escapes injury as the crowd turns nasty. With the John Doe clubs disbanded, the myth exposed, and the girl he loves out of his life, John makes up his mind to re-ignite the fire of the John Doe Movement by the only way that will prove that he is no longer a fake and that Norton's scheme can never transpire, and that is to obey the original text of the ficitious letter and to jump from the tower of the city hall. Arnold's performance is outstanding as is Cooper's, and as he closes his eyes in silent prayer moments before he is to make his death leap brings a lump to your throat, and one of Stanwyk's final lines is equally as Moving ' If it's worth dying for then it's worth living for' Capra's film is strong to this date, and 60 odd years on has not dated as it gives a message as prevalent today as it was then. people can debate whether or not Capra deliberately made Doe out as a Christ-like figure till doomsday for all I care, I like the movie because it demonstrates that even the most ordinary man can make a difference.",24,26,True
tt0033891,"With Significant Editing, This Might Have Been a Much Better Movie",4.0,"""Meet John Doe"" has in it some good performances. Walter Brennan played Gary Cooper's cynical hobo friend almost to perfection, at least as well as the role could be played given the flawed script. He saw the conventional world as one full of ""heelots"" (lots of heels) who were only after the other guy's money. Cooper, as John Doe, handed in a credible performance, as well, and Barbara Stanwick, when she wasn't overacting, was generally interesting to watch and easy on the eyes. The actors portraying the newspaper editor and the media magnate were also effective. But this story and this script, while reaching for greater meaning, had the unfortunate tendency to fall back on schmaltzy clichés and flag-waving propaganda and that kept the movie from realizing its full promise and potential. Director Capra, whose talents were greatly admired in the movie industry, didn't seem able to make up his mind if he wanted this thing to be a somewhat saccharine, albeit uplifting Christmas movie about people forgetting their petty differences and coming together, or something quite different, that being a cynical and gritty political statement about the rich and powerful's compelling need to use and abuse the common man. The movie tried to combine elements of both themes yet it only partly succeeded on either score. In contrast, ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which attempted much the same thing, succeeded where ""Meet John Doe"" missed the mark. It was a far more effective Christmas movie, yet at the same time contained significant elements that examined dishonesty, cruelty, and greed. Still, ""Meet John Doe,"" a less admired, less focused, and less consistent effort featured some compelling scenes. I thought the argument between Doe and DB Norton, the fascist media magnate who was hoping to launch a presidential bid on the strength of the John Doe Clubs, was probably the best scene in the film, although Walter Brennan's speech about the ""heelots"" was also quite good. The mob scene, reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion, no doubt was intended to be the film's most powerful sequence, and on balance it was fairly gripping. Unfortunately, it contained obvious continuity errors that detracted seriously from its believability. For example, Norton's troopers grabbed Doe to stop him from speaking to the crowd and exposing Norton's evil scheme, then all of a sudden, they released him and stood back, allowing him to weakly defend himself in front of the mike. Whereas the mob seemed to sympathize with him even when disillusioned by the disturbing allegations leveled against him, suddenly they were out for his blood. It didn't really add up, at least not as it unfolded. The last scene in the movie, where Doe climbed City Hall intending to commit suicide, aspired to be a very moving moment but was even more flawed. The magnate and his fellow conspirators were on hand and they didn't want him to go through with it because it might spoil their attempts to salvage what was left of their meglomaniacal aims, but evidently they felt somewhat guilty for their part in his destruction. Doe simply brushed them aside, and in what was perhaps Coop's most convincing moment, he was just about to leap to his death when Barbara Stanwick dashed forward to stop him. Unfortunately, that's when the movie took a real nosedive. Her lines were painfully contrived and delivered in a thoroughly unconvincing manner. As such, the ending was like the rest of the flick, inching up on something quite good and then falling flat. Too bad; with more polishing, significant editing and re-shooting, it could have been a much better movie.",15,24,False

tt0033891,"A little heavy-handed, but a wonderful film",8.0,"Director Frank Capra lays it on pretty thick here, with a message combining the love of one's fellow man, the need to defend America's freedoms, and the power of common people to stand up to the rich and powerful when they band together and act out of decency and truth. This is a film filled with big idealistic speeches and moments meant to stir the heart. Capra knew that the democracy faced threats all over the globe as WWII loomed, but also that America, like any other country, faced threats within, that it was possible that an authoritarian may rise to power here by exploiting the masses, and controlling the media. This was a real possibility in the 1940's, and of course, is still relevant today. It's very telling that at the beginning of the movie, a newspaper is being taken over by a rich industrialist, who wants to stimulate circulation at any cost. The plaque outside the building reading ""A free press means free people"" is chiseled away, and replaced with one reading ""A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined age."" When a plucky young reporter (Barbara Stanwyck) keeps her job only by writing a fake letter from a John Doe, we're at first led to believe that the deception is for the better, because she uses the resulting column to push altruistic messages extracted from her late father's old writing. She and the newspaper editor (James Gleason) hire a local vagrant (Gary Cooper) to play the part of John Doe, and the message expands and catches on, so much so that 'John Doe Clubs' are being formed all over the country.The message they push is one against all sorts of ills: the collapse of decency, corruption in local politics, graft in state relief, and hospitals shutting their doors to the needy. The idea is that if people could live up to Christian ideals all year round, rather than just at Christmas-time, that if they could simply 'love thy neighbor' and exercise tolerance for one another, they would not only feel better about life, but it would solve some of society's problems. All seems well, but lurking is the rich industrialist (Edward Arnold) funding the whole thing, initially for what seems to be the common good, but sure enough, he has ulterior motives. Thus, love your fellow man, but beware those seeking to control you. And for all his optimism and faith in man, Capra knew that a mob whipped into a frenzy was dangerous, and there are some dark elements in the film.Edward Arnold is brilliant as the industrialist, and Gleason is excellent as the editor. The two of them turn in great performances in their supporting roles, with Gleason's speech while drunk (""Yep, I'm a sucker for this country..."") is one of the film's strongest. He extols the idea that the freedoms enjoyed in America to speak and live freely were important, and far preferable to the totalitarian governments at both ends of the political spectrum in the world (e.g. Fascist Germany and the Communist Soviet Union). If that sounds like a nationalistic message it is, but it was appropriate for the period, and more than balanced out by the socialist and anti-materialistic messages. Barbara Stanwyck is a delight to watch as always, and 1941 was a fantastic here for her ('Ball of Fire', also with Cooper, and 'The Lady Eve' came out that year). She's a wee melodramatic in the film's final scene though. Gary Cooper is just average in playing the bumbling everyman, and not as strong as Jimmy Stewart in similar roles for Capra. He is awkward and wide-eyed too often, especially early in the film. On the other hand, he shows a little bit of a devilish side in his subconscious, describing a dream of spanking Stanwyck at length (a scene which is a little odd). His best exchange with Stanwyck occurs when he senses she's also corrupt, and asks her ""Did you write this?"", referring to his next speech, she confesses yes but ""I had no idea what was going on"", and he pushes past her, remarking ""That's a swell bracelet you're wearing,"" noticing the expensive gift she's received. He then proceeds to stand up to a group of powerful men, speaking for the little guy (""I'm just a mug and I know it. But I'm beginning to understand a lot of things. Why your types are as old as history. If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea, and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs! If you can't eat something you bury it!"")If it's not already apparent, if you're cynical by nature, this is probably not the film for you. And, I have to say, Capra uses just a teensy bit too much of a heavy hand here, among other things likening John Doe to Jesus Christ (you know, that other great socialist who preached love and tolerance). However, he also has brilliant moments when he lets everything linger, such as when the crowd is disillusioned and wonders who is telling them the truth. That moment is simply spellbinding. Solid film, with wonderful messages.",17,18,False
tt0033891,More contemporary than ever,10.0,"This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The ""John Doe Clubs"" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the ""Little Man"", just like the ""Tea Party Movement"" today (which one quipster rightly has called ""an exercise in mass false consciousness""). These movements of the ""little man"" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the ""Know-Nothings"" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the ""Poujadistes"", in Italy the ""Qualunquisti""); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating ""the little people"", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.",10,14,False

John Doe (Cooper) asks the reporter played by Stanwyck.Exactly what I was thinking.Sure, the setup is fantastic -- Fat, obnoxious, wealthy megalomaniac with no ethical compass buys a newspaper and cleans house, promising a new kind of journalism while really just pushing a particular political philosphy. I like to think of him as Conrad Black.Freshly fired reporter makes up one last fantasy column on her way out the door. Stanwyck's character basically expresses her frustration as a poor shmoe reporter, but invents John Doe as a cover for her anti-establishment gripes.Fair enough, let's see where this goes.Unfortunately, other than a compelling early monologue from fellow hobo Walter Brennan basically stating, ''you don't own your stuff, your stuff owns you,"" to put it in Fight Club terms, this movie comes across as made-up-on-the-fly populist mumbo-jumbo. Then there's the ''America H3ll Ya"" radio speech plotzed into the movie to rouse Iowa farmboys to join Uncle Sam's army and fight the little guy with the moustache or Hirohito, or whomever. The soda jerk's interminable monologue. The dream explanation by Cooper where he pantomime's spanking Stanwyck. Errrrr. ummmm. OK. Gleason's drunken pro-America gibberish in the bar and admission of shenanigans.Frankly, long before the end I just didn't care anymore because whatever viewpoint Capra thought he'd started with had already lept to its death and splattered on the sidwalk below.The actualy ending, to nobody's surprise, was the product of some dimwit theatregoer's viewer feedback card.

tt0033891,As timely in 2016 as it was 75 years ago.,9.0,"City hall wouldn't be my choice as where to jump off a roof on Christmas Eve. A highly guarded tower in mid Manhattan would be my choice if I was inclined to do something like that. A big wealthy blowhard proves that corruption is king, and with political ambitions decides to run for President. But it's not quite time for the Antichrist to take over, and no amount of journalistic manipulation will change that, whether it's through social media or their own newspaper. Edward Arnold is the ruthless D.B. Norton whose obsession with power causes him to take over a dying newspaper, turning it around with sensation, but underestimating the power of the people: the real people. That's where the stars of this Frank Capra classic comes in, them being fired journalist Barbara Stanwyck and jobless baseball player Gary Cooper, hired by rehired Stanwyck and editor James Gleason to represent the average American man who will fulfill Stanwyck's column to represent the man who intends to jump off the roof on Christmas eve.There's been constant discussion over this film for its message and especially over its conclusion. It's a masterpiece in many ways, certainly nor flawless, and exceptionally well acted. It's a reunion for Capra and Stanwyck, their first together in 8 years, coming at the height of her popularity, with three classics in one year, and one of two she starred in that year with Cooper. Stanwyck is feminine but tough, no namby pamby broad, ruthless in her ambitions, and yet with a strong ethical code that the promise of a ton of cash cannot buy. Cooper continues his continuation of the all American hero. Supporting the two are imperious Arnold, wise cracking Gleason, and ornery Walter Brennan, giving his all as Cooper's sidekick. Spring Byington, Regis Toomey, Sterling Holloway and Gene Lockhart are secondary players who stand out amongst the usual assortment of Capra's regular ensemble players. It dies get a bit corny at times, but there are many moments that are really truth telling and honest.

Even in the most difficult times, it will be the real people who ""trump"" the tyrants.",10,12,True
tt0033891,A very good film from Frank Capra,8.0,"I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding.

A lot of movies were made at this time with the purpose of keeping spirits up, and presenting what the American ideal was all about.;This movie is full of symbolism. Every scene and every utterance has a message.  A common man elevated-- being pulled in both directions.  On the one hand, by a beautiful woman, on the other hand, by his old life- represented by Walter Brennan.  Almost everyone in the movie praises the goodness of man, as long as man is on the right side and can be manipulated. There is a scene of a crowd in one accord, praising their hero-- the reverse image of a Hitler rally, because these people were good.  Suddenly it starts to rain, and everyone has a large black umbrella.  As they sing ""God Bless America"" the overhead shot shows the tops of the umbrellas gently moving in unison-- ""huddled masses"".  Then the mood of the crowd changes-- can anyone say ""Crucify him?""  The same people who love him, suddenly hate him.  Later in the movie Barbara Stanwyck reminds him of the John Doe of 2000 years ago.  Christ. A beautiful tall building, glowing in the dark. A symbolism of capitalism. Anyone who wasn't around during the l940's, or have not read the history of that time.  will miss all the symbolism- but the symbols are very clear to those in the know.

The idea that newspapers only care about profit, and function as tools to promote a message decided by the people in power is an important one. Showing the effects of poverty in America in little vignettes (her mom feeding people, how many men showed up as John Doe, the stories from the town w/ the first john doe club) The message that people should take care of their neighbors was also a good message to promote.I was enjoying how the film was both dark and realistic and also so idealistic in proposing we could change things.Suddenly though, John Doe becomes Jesus being lynched by a mob and offering to take his life for the people? I could have lived with that allusion, but the final rooftop scene where Ann explains to John that he is Jesus was just too much for me! I can stand a certain amount of sappy idealism- I thought Ann's quote ""if it's good enough to die for, it's good enough to live for"" was a great line. Is it so impossible for people to be good people and care about their neighbors without religion having to be thrown in?Gary Cooper & Barbara Stanwyck were fantastic as usual, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone other than a die-hard Cooper/Stanwyck/Capra fan.I was pleased to read in others comments that there were alternate endings (if they still exist, please add them to the DVD!!), too bad they picked this one.",4,10,True

Almost every character was written-in to be as annoying as possible - not saying the actors didn't try their best, considering the mess they were given to work with. At least Danielle C. Ryan was bearable and convincing in this role, unlike her character in Double Threat.For starters, I've never seen an FBI agent be portrayed so sappy, useless, desperate, and as if they would be allowed to carry a gun as and alcoholic with endless bottles of booze always in her hand. Never mind making her character so trampy and desperate. A high school drama class could create better characters, and a story for that matter. Then the two female leads felt like they were competing who had bigger balls, both being unrealistic with their tough-act attitudes. Even some scenes with annoyingly irrelevant and infantile dialogue became cringeworthy quickly.There were endless plot holes, riddled with unrealistic scenarios - almost as if zero research was done on how things actually are supposed to happen. There were missing parts to many scenes, not sure if the blame falls on the editor or the director, but certainly any decent director should pick-up on at least the obvious inconsistencies (like how may time does the one guy pull back the slide of his gun when it's already chambered the first time around, and never shot). Like I said, amateur-hour, and I should've known better, considering this duo - director Shane Stanley and writer CJ Walley gave us Double Threat, also starring the same two female leads, in another cringeworthy attempt at an action-thriller. I need to remember to stay away from any more of their filmsI wouldn't even recommend this as a one-time watch, because it's that sappy and cheesy, and the characters are that annoying.

tt15727212,"Wonderfully ridiculous fun, troubled only by overload and imbalance",8.0,"I was a big fan of 2022's 'Double threat,' a hilarious if slightly imbalanced action-comedy romp also starring Danielle C. Ryan, written by CJ Walley, and directed by Shane Stanley. With the same principals attached, and a premise that portends total low-grade bluster, I've been looking forward to this from the moment I first caught wind of it. Considering that after only two scenes and seven minutes I had to pause to collect myself, things are looking up from the very beginning. I can understand why such ridiculous fare doesn't appeal to all comers, yet I can only lament that in 2023 folks still don't seem to get B-movies, for that's the only reason I can discern why 'Night Train' has seemingly been met with such poor reception.Walley begins with reasonable foundations in his screenplay and then just twists them every which way. The dialogue fundamentally serviceable as a concept, but often ridiculous and ham-handed or over the top. Characters are formed around sound ideas - a hard-nose FBI suit, a hard-living ""loose cannon"" of a field officer, a struggling single mother - but taken to delightful extremes. That goes not least for protagonist Holly, who in addition to being a single mother is also a drag racer, apparently a professional racer, an expert in auto engineering, a union crew member in the film industry, and as the premise suggests, a smuggler. (This is almost as good as Cynthia Rothrock's character in 'Sworn to justice,' who is a psychic, a martial artist, and a lawyer.) And then there's the story: the second scene gives us all the most significant exposition, and while Walley gladly suggests monied interests, capitalist malfeasance, and political corruption making Holly's ""side gig"" profitable and necessary, he then goes as blunt and forthright as possible in asserting the nature of all the players behind the scenes. And it's utterly glorious.So it goes on down the line, with everything about 'Night Train' being some combination of wholly overcooked, gauche, frank, unsubtle... you get the idea. This applies to instances of if not in some cases the entirety of the production design and art direction, Stanley's direction, Joel Layogan's cinematography, hair and makeup, the selected soundtrack, and not least the acting, all in addition to Walley's writing. Dan Radlauer's score is actually rather terrific all on its own, but is sometimes used in a manner that's completely overdone. Scenes (romance) or details (hair and makeup) may be perfectly fine and normal in and of themselves, but in their particular application in this feature become preposterous; some facets that are inherently glaring and questionable - the male gaze, a predominantly and dubiously white cast - are somehow more so here. Ryan is as pretty, charming, and disarming as she can be; Diora Baird plays Jackson as the most messed up, floundering, ""barely able to stand"" person she can; Joseph D. Reitman is just having a ball, whatever that might mean to him in the moment; Abraham Benrubi revels in his overacting; and so on, and so on. The project seems to take advantage of all the fanciest equipment it can get its paws on, the remote filming locations, and the long stretches of highway to make the end result look as slick and impressive as possible, to the point of subsequently (wittingly or not) amplifying the inauthenticity.And still, for all this: none of it is sloppy, or accidental. All this is entirely on purpose. Sincere storytelling, some sharp dialogue, earnest performances, expert direction, solid craftsmanship, some important and admirable themes and ideas - all nevertheless reshaped or employed in a fashion that's sometimes sincerely engaging, at others cheekily funny, but consistently mostly just outrageous. And it's so wonderfully entertaining! Truthfully, the only specific problem I'm seeing here is that in sum the movie is distinctly imbalanced. Each constituent part is excellent; the issue is how 'Night Train' oscillates between laugh-worthy nonsense, and generally enjoyable nonsense; genuine barbed wit, appreciable themes, or bright commentary, and honest soul-baring emoting and character writing; straight, meaningful narrative and development thereof, and pure bluster; and, incredibly, more. For everything that this picture tries to say, do, and be, it's full of splendid ideas; if it had elected to solely be a serious take-down of corporate and political corruption, for example, or an outright comedy-thriller, it would be plainly outstanding. For the fact of rolling it all together into a single ninety-minute production, it's more than a little overloaded, and consequently disjointed. Yet all told - I also don't think it's unreasonable to suppose that this ultimately works in the title's favor. After all, the feature has already committed to absurdity, so why not take it a step further by going overboard in the most basic of ways?What it comes down to, I think, is that this is fabulously fun and ludicrous, and the trouble is that it can't decide what kind of Ludicrous it wants to be. If it had eliminated even just one or two flavors or tones from its veritable buffet than the end product would have been tightened. Even at that, though, I'd be plainly lying if I said I didn't have a great time watching. Walley, Stanley, Ryan, and all others involved once again impress by churning out a slyly, purposefully overblown slice of silliness, and somehow giving it a beating heart of deeper value that irregularly shines through. Though it's inherently uneven and therefore flawed for all that it tries to weave in, I think this is broadly well made, and a joyful, satisfying viewing experience. I suppose in fairness that I do understand why this may not meet with equal success even among those who already go in for B-movies, but all I can say is that when all is said and done, much more than not I think this is a blast. If you enjoy films that are off the beaten path, unreservedly deliberate bunkum, and don't mind imperfections, 'Night Train' earns a hearty recommendation and a thumbs-up from me.",8,19,False

But, it's kinda awkward.I think Night Train is a strange mash-up of: F&F, Motocrossed (90s kids, you're welcome - and they could have developed this a lot. Like why is this the one thing she and her dad see eye-to-eye on?), The Cleaning Lady, Will Trent, and Lethal Weapon (I'm sorry, but Riggs but without Murtaugh. You'll see). I enjoy all of those movies or shows individually, but it's like there are small elements of each scattered in this movie that don't quite make sense.I think I could have liked this movie if there were character and plot development, continuity, etc. It may have better as a series to allow the writers to back up and show us more of the characters' potential. Only because I made it through to the end, I wouldn't mind seeing a much better sequel or prequel.",9,14,True
tt15727212,Fun-Fueled Indie Flick,9.0,"Night Train is a fun, low-budget flick for people who enjoy going for a ride. The movie opens with a beautifully shot racing scene and the audience is thrown right into the action.Single mother Holly is the best racer around with her altered truck. Everyone hates her, of course. How dare a woman drive better than them? But they don't know. She's fighting for her son's life because he's all she's got. So she turns to the black market for his medication.Jaylene is a vet assigned to a hard-nosed FBI agent. He mistakes her PSTD for drug addiction. She's just trying to survive and catch the bad guys. But how can she get the bad guys when she can't tell if she's one of them?Soon, Jaylene is hot on Holly's trail. Twists and turns abound from start to finish. I highly recommend watching until the end, or else you'll miss a well-executed twist.At its heart, Night Train is about two strong women racing to reach the finish line, only to find that line is blurry with morals and politics.The only reason I gave this movie nine stars is that I wished it was longer.",5,14,False
tt15727212,The two blonde white women were confusing at first,2.0,"The two blonde white women were confusing at first, but then I figured out that the mom has straight hair while the cop's is wavy, so that solves that.The acting style in this movie was ultra-innovative. Keeping it obvious that they were reading lines made the movie very enjoyable even with the AI written plot.The fact that this cinematic creation is only 100 times worse than the greatest achievement in all of film-making history - Fast and Furious, means it is still in the top 100 movies of all time!Danielle Ryan is beautiful.The joke about the the guy who keeps asking the girl if she has seen the triple-headed dragon in the kitchen making waffles - and then she replies No, have you seen my crystal meth? Was really funny and priginal.",7,12,False
tt15727212,"A very enjoyable ride with a great ""F you!"" ending, the kind I really like",9.0,"I admit I'm not a tough critic, but I really enjoyed this film. I've been watching a ton of action movies lately, and this was definitely one of the better ones:It deals with an important issue, one that's close to home and affects a lot of people;;I definitely cared about the characters;;It made sense and had an awesome ending.Big Pharma is an abomination from the deepest depths of Hell, so definitely screw them. The Feds are certainly corrupt, so that's accurate. The two blonde white women were confusing at first, but then I figured out that the mom has straight hair while the cop's is wavy, so that solves that.I think the plot makes perfect sense. It's realistic, and there's a good amount of emotional depth, especially near the end. As I said, I cared about the characters, and that's important to me.I had no problem with it being an action movie with no on-screen shooting; who needs that?!Overall, I recommend it.",4,11,True
tt15727212,Movie making and what not to make,1.0,"Tried watching this and to be honest, it was painful. The storyline was not bad but the main actress was bouncing around so much I was getting dizzy. How can a character be so busy working and making money that they can't pay their bills. So whoever wrote this needs to research better characters.As far as racing a motorcycle above the speed limit that your father says to test it, that was a wasted scene.As for the female officer it was all bulls**t. Her squeaky voice annoyed me. Her lethargic way of conducting her job was ridiculous.It was a waste of the 30 minutes I invested in this bad movie.I did like the mechanic. He was the best part of this catastrophe.",6,10,False
tt15727212,Friendly,5.0,"It's showing individuals lives, with out the guns and blood or a spray of blood exiting a head wound on the green screen. I think it fresh and I like how it shows individual character. I'm just 16.51 in. I will review more in the second act. I'm liking the 2 leed charters. She took the money from the boss. She didn't recognize, The Set Up.im still liking the figuring out the personalities. And the investigator is a alcoholic. And suffering from PTSD. One is volatile, and the other cautious. Family values between daughter and father. And then the confrontation. The conversation and, The Challenge!",4,10,False
tt15727212,"Good acting, good writing, story driven",8.0,"This is GOOD! But not in the spoon-fed, guns-blazing, survive-three-car-crashes way something like Fast and Furious is. But this show has deep characters, great, believable dialogue, real situations that are messy and hard to get out of. The budget might be lower than your average multimillion dollar Netflix movie, but that means you can watch it without the guilt of knowing an army of homeless people could have been fed, but instead you wanted to be entertained. This is good storytelling and good acting carrying the plot without glitz and glamour. If you're looking for the next visually stunning epic, keep looking...or better yet try it because it might challenge your status quo perception of what is considered good cinema.",3,9,False
tt15727212,Not that bad,6.0,"This was a pretty decent movie. I'm surprised it had so many bad reviews. Sure, it's not fast and the furious levels of awesome, but it was clearly made on a budget.The story is basic, but compelling enough to keep you interested. The casting was actually pretty good for budget actors. I believed what they were selling for the whole movie. Sure, the plot moved slow, then fast and there definitely some instances that didn't make a ton of sense but moved the plot forward.My main critique is throwing in mechanical jargon that sounds legit, and kind of is, but real car people know that street racers and mechanics would never talk like that in real life.Overall, it's worth a watch. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but I did enjoy it.",3,9,False
tt15727212,I love a good B movie but this ain't one,,"Simply horrific in every aspect. Bad acting, zero action, horrible dialogue.Reviewer skiplewis-49403 sums it up best.""Cringe worthy and unwatchable. I couldn't even finish watching this junk to see the ending. Just really bad acting and a terrible script. There wasn't one part of this movie I found enjoyable. I had low expectations going into it and the movie was even worse than I expected I could barely pay attention and almost fell asleep. Terrible cast and laughable action scenes. Plot is not believable whatsoever. Seems to be the norm for most movies released nowadays . The fact that this was even released is comical. It's a real shame how bad movies have become. I would definitely not recommend watching this movie to anyone . Nails on a chalkboard bad.""",6,8,False
tt15727212,Two leads are really good actors,6.0,"I don't understand the low rating here. Is it because the two lead actors are female? I thought the acting was spot on by both leads (Danielle C. Ryan and Diora Baird) and the supporting cast as well, especially Joseph Reitman and Paul Haapaniemi. The dialogue was better than expected, certainly superior to anything written by M. Night Shyamalan. Yeah, the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense (why the need to speed to Las Vegas?) and some of the music was annoying but other than that, it was a solid flick. Also, the title of the movie could have been better, Night Train sounds like a horror movie that takes place on Amtrak.",3,8,False
